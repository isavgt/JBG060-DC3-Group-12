1,486,"Juba - The Political Bureau of Sudan People Liberation Movement - In Opposition (SPLM-IO) on Wednesday condemned generals who announced the 'ouster' of First Vice President Riek Machar from his political and military positions. On Wednesday, a group of senior generals in SPLM-IO announced they had dismissed Dr Machar as commander of the group, accusing him of reneging on the movement's vision. The SPLM-IO generals ostensibly replaced Machar with his previous army Chief Simon Gatwech Dual with immediate effect. ""He [Dr Riek Machar] no longer represents the interest of the wider population in South Sudan - as he has become a part of the national government, compromising fundamental issues, hence his views are not helping the movement [SPLM/A-IO],"" said the group spokesperson Brigadier General William Gatjiath Deng then. But on Wednesday, Dr Machar's allies dismissed the announcement. Later in a press statement seen by The EastAfrican on Thursday, the opposition party senior political unit described the generals behind the announcement as ""peace spoilers."" ""The bureau condemns in the strongest terms the ill-fated Kit-Gwang declaration. The three generals who met in Magnels don't constitute SPLA-IO (military force of SPLM-IO) leadership of the Military Command. ""The Military Command is composed of the Commander in Chief, Chief of General Staff and his deputies, commanders of nine sectors, and commander of general headquarters. By the time the pronouncement was issued, Gen Gatwech had been relieved [of his position as the Chief of General Staff] and appointed Presidential advisor for peace,"" reads the statement. The party political bureau added that the generals' announcement was intended to derail the formation of a unified professional national army. ""However, the situation is calm and we assure the people of South Sudan that it is under control"". According to the 2018 peace accord, all opposition and government forces are supposed to be trained and unified under one professional national army, a condition that is yet to be fulfilled.",0,0.0,juba political bureau sudan people liberation movement opposition splm io wednesday condemned generals announced ouster first vice president riek machar political military positions

2,596,"Bentiu - ""I used to collect firewood, make charcoal, and sell fresh milk to help meet our family's needs,"" Nyachar Gatneay Rial, 38, told UNFPA. ""Now I have to sell tea in the local market to earn some money."" Ms. Rial's family are among some 220,000 people whose homes and livelihoods were demolished by floods in South Sudan's Unity State in July 2020, and who have spent years on the move in search of refuge in camps for internally displaced populations. The flooding laid waste to crops and homes, leaving thousands of already impoverished families without any shelter or way of earning a living. The ongoing conflict and growing insecurity in South Sudan expose women and girls to ever greater risks of gender-based and sexual violence. Diang Juoy Tutchar, 39, is a widow and mother of five children. She said, ""We know the firewood collection areas are unsafe because of the threat of violence. There are also wild animals like snakes and crocodiles, so it is especially dangerous when we have to cross a flooded field to get wood."" An estimated 2.6 million people in South Sudan are at risk of gender-based violence in 2022, a staggering 25 per cent increase on 2021 estimates. Nearly 40 per cent of women and girls reported having to avoid essential public places like water points, washrooms and markets, as well as firewood collection sites, out of fear of being attacked, raped or sexually exploited. Gender-based violence: From protection to prevention Ms. Rial hasn't had a stable place she could call home for the past decade. Along with her husband and four children, she has been forced to move around conflict-ridden Unity State to escape violence, floods and drought, in a constant search for safety and security. Over two thirds of South Sudan's population - some 8.9 million people - need urgent humanitarian assistance to survive cascading crises, from widespread violence, entrenched conflict, public health challenges, and catastrophic climate shocks. Across South Sudan, UNFPA supports safe spaces for women and girls affected by humanitarian crises, providing sexual and reproductive health services, protection and information in a secure setting that reached more than 3,300 survivors in 2021. Staff also offer case management for survivors, group and individual psychosocial support, and referrals to legal services if needed. To help women and girls regain their self-reliance and earn a living in less dangerous environments, UNFPA supports a variety of life skills training. This can range from learning how to tailor clothes or make jewellery, to producing reusable sanitary pads and face masks: More than 700,000 women and girls in 2020 seized these opportunities in 2020 alone. Risking their lives to protect their families Ms. Rial said she has seen too many women deserted or threatened by their husbands when they were no longer able to provide for their families, some forced into treacherous situations to earn an income. Women often travel in large groups to protect themselves when venturing out for work, and make sure to be back before nightfall. ""We don't have any other option; we have to survive and support our families. We need to send our children to school,"" explained Ms. Tutchar. More than half of the 2 million people currently displaced within South Sudan are women and girls, who are at high risk of gender-based violence and forced and child marriage. Many parents turn to child and forced marriage as a safeguard from grinding poverty, especially during a crisis and when they can't afford to send young girls to school: UNICEF estimates that half of all girls in South Sudan are married before the age of 18. In 2020, with generous support from the governments of Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway and Sweden and the European Union's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations fund (ECHO), UNFPA was able to reach over 15,000 girls at risk of gender-based violence and forced or child marriage with protection and prevention services. More than 228,000 gender-based violence survivors were also supported through medical care, psychosocial support and legal assistance.",-1,0.0,bentiuused collect firewood make charcoal sell fresh milk

3,664,"TANZANIA'S Under- 23 team test South Sudan hurdle today in the 2021 CECAFA Youth Challenge Cup semi-final at Bahri Dar International Stadium in Ethiopia. Tanzania sailed to the CECAFA semis after commanding its group with four points following a 1-0 victory against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 1-1 draw over Uganda in the same venue. Following its command in group A, the Tanzanian Head Coach Kim Poulsen asserted that they are happy to step in the semifinals as their group was tough, insisting that they will not underrate South Sudan. ""We are very happy to qualify for the semi-finals because our preparations were close to zero since the Tanzania Premier League has just ended. We were also in a tough group, and we surely battled strongly to make it to the next stage.I think Uganda also deserved to be in the semi-final because they play well. We shall not underrate our opponents South Sudan whom we face in the semi-final. We shall have to approach the semi-final match very differently."" In another development, Tanzania's first-choice goalkeeper Boniface Mnata Metacha will miss the semi-final clash following his suspension after accumulating two yellow cards in the group games against DRC and Uganda. Tanzania will then have to adjust to either opt for Daniel Mgore or Wilbol Changarawe. Following the suspension, Poulsen noted, ""It's unfortunate that Metacha will miss the semifinal clash because he put up a good show in the two games. But we shall adjust the team accordingly,"" Their opponents, South Sudan, stepped in the semis after picking the runner-up of Group B. They faced a 2-0 defeat from Kenya Emerging Stars on their first encounter and later won 2-0 over Djibouti. The regional tournament began this month on the 18th, and its climax sets to be July 30th. After the first semi-final encounter, Group B leader Burundi will take over Group C leader Kenya at Bahri Dar International Stadium in Ethiopia. Burundi led Group B after accumulating four points; they picked a 3-0 victory against Eritrea before collecting a 1-1 draw over Ethiopia's host team.

4,720,"Juba - South Sudan's government has dismissed claims that it is supporting the rebel group, Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Addressing members of the press after the regular Council of Ministers in Juba over the weekend, Information Minister Michael Makuei said President Salva Kiir would never support the rebel group, citing Ethiopia's support during South Sudan's liberation struggle from Sudan is unforgettable. ""The people and the government of Ethiopia all these years have been standing with us, and without Ethiopia's government support, we would not have been independent today. ""So, there is no way we can say we are supporting the rebels to overthrow the system in Ethiopia. Not only that, but also what are our resources? If we are unable even to graduate our forces now because of the absence of arms, should we give arms to the rebels and leave our forces?"" he said. Makuei assured Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy of South Sudan's position and support for the current government. ""This we have to make it very clear and assure the government of Ethiopia that we are with them, that we are with the government and the people of Ethiopia and we will never work against them in any way. ""If there are any individuals who might be selling arms, then these are individuals who might have been in possession of their own private firearms,"" Makuei added. The Information Minister added that Abiy's regime should hold to account the people selling arms to TPLF. Two weeks ago, PM Abiy defended his frontline actions and declared 'victory' over the TPLF. The premier's office said that his actions did not negate the need for peace, just that his forces were pushing back against a group he labelled terrorist. When the national forces first launched attacks on TPLF in November 2020, Abiy declared an end to the operation five weeks later, but the fighting continued. By late June, the rebels had retaken most of Tigray, including Mekele. TPLF has in recent weeks claimed they were on a march to Addis Ababa, raising the urgency of calls for a ceasefire. Last month, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a swift end to the fighting.",-1,0.0,juba south sudangovernment dismissed claims supporting rebel group tigray peopleliberation front tplf

7,1989,"Kampala - As Uganda Cranes aim to draw first blood against neighbours South Sudan in the Chan qualifiers this evening, veteran coach Leo Adraa, who has handled both national teams, offers a few winning tips. ""Cranes should know that South Sudan will enjoy home advantage. Their pitch in Juba City is unplayable and the players tend to fight harder before their home fans,"" Adraa, who resigned the South Sudan job over delayed payment told Daily Monitor yesterday. The former Uganda Cranes player and coach, who is now managing Arua side Onduparaka, reveals that many South Sudan players have crossed over and played in Ugandan leagues and will use that to frustrate Cranes today. ""Apart from the big number of players in their elite club Malakia, players like Robert Wurube and Peter Dusman have been in Uganda before and know our style. ""Cranes should respect them and plan to stop their attacks especially by marking out their lead striker Dusman,"" he added. The last training sessions suggest the Uganda Cranes coach Micho Sredojevic will go for Ismail Watenga in goal and the backline of Nicholas Wadada, Timothy Awany, Bernard Muwanga and Isaac Muleme. To galvanize the midfield away from home, Micho may opt for Deus Bukenya, Muzamir Mutyaba, Brian Majwega and Tom Masiko. Skipper Geoffrey Sserunkuma is expected to thrive alone upfront as the 47-year old tactician searches for away points. ""We always play a balanced approach of attacking and defending as the game dictates. We are going for victory in Juba because I trust my team,"" Micho observed yesterday.

8,2109,"South Sudan's vice-president designate Riek Machar is now expected to arrive in Juba this week after the government backed down on its earlier position that the rebel leader would not be allowed to return to the country with sophisticated weapons such as laser-guided and anti-tank missiles. Adel Sandrai, a Sudanese People's Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO) Member of Parliament told The EastAfrican from Juba that Dr Machar was ready to travel to Juba but his arrival depended on whether the government clears the former rebels' weapons. ""The First Vice-President designate is ready to return to Juba but the government must accept that our forces come with their guns,"" said Mr Sandrai. Festus Mogae, former president of Botswana, who is also the chairman of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), had given Dr Machar till April 23 to return to Juba or the commission would report to the United Nations Security Council that the peace implementation process had broken down. Should Dr Machar fail to arrive at the capital and Dr Mogae reports to the UN Security Council that the two partners have blocked the implementation of the peace process, then Dr Machar and President Salva Kiir are likely to be slapped with sanctions, including travel bans and asset-freezes. Since Dr Machar's scheduled return to Juba was aborted on April 18, the two main partners to the peace process have been locked in a dispute over how many soldiers and the type of weapons Dr Machar can bring with him to Juba. JMEC had on Thursday proposed that Dr Machar return with 195 soldiers along with 20 PK machine guns, 20 RPG-7 grenade launchers, shells and rounds of ammunition. But Information Minister Michael Makuei had earlier in the week maintained that the government would only allow Dr Machar to come with seven PKMs and seven RPGs. South Sudan ambassador to Kenya Jimmy Deng told The EastAfrican that the government had accepted the JMEC proposal but accused Dr Machar of continuously issuing new demands. Following the government's approval, SPLM-IO chief of staff Gen Simon Gatwech -- who had been stranded in Gambela in southern Ethiopia for four days after the government refused clear his travel because of the weapons -- was expected to be in Juba by Friday afternoon. Dr Machar's deputy, Gen Alfred Lado Gore, landed in Juba on April 12 in preparation for the return of the former rebel leader on April 18. Dr Machar has maintained that he will only travel to Juba a day after Gen Gatwech arrives to take charge of the 1,370 troops that are already in their camp in Jebel Kujur south of Juba. SPLM-IO are still entitled to bring an additional 1,540 soldiers to bring the total number of soldiers and police officers to 2,910 as per the security arrangements agreed on in Addis Ababa in October last year. President Kiir will retain 5,000 presidential guards and joint police personnel. Dr Machar has routinely attributed his long-delayed return to Juba to the refusal of the government to withdraw extra troops from Juba, while the government has been citing lack of funds to set up camps and feed the soldiers.",-1,0.0,south sudanvice president designate riek machar expected arrive juba week government backed earlier position rebel leader would allowed return country

10,3429,"Arusha - THE South Sudan Intra- SPLM dialogue which had been taking place in Arusha for quite some time now is set to resume again on the 5th of January 2015 with the three parties admitting to record good progress. The Arusha II (phase I) South Sudan dialogue has on the other hand concluded at Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge in Meru District under the auspices of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, facilitated by the CCM's former Vice-Chairman, Dr John Samuel Malecela. ""We delegates of the Intra-SPLM Dialogue have been sitting here for talks between the 23rd and 24th of December 2014 in the spirit of the framework document and the communiqué signed last October,"" stated the delegates in a statement signed by Comrades Akol Paul Kordit and Duer Tut Duer. They said once they reconvene next month, they intend to advance the agenda set forth in the framework document and the communiqué under collective responsibility for ending the crisis that engulfed the republic of South Sudan. Previously on the 20th of October, this year, the Chairman of Tanzania's ruling party (CCM), President Jakaya Kikwete attended the climax of the first rounds of talks and lauded the efforts by the South Sudan delegation to end crisis in the country through unifying the two split factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. ""This will spare the people of South Sudan from enduring more sufferings brought about by civil wars that have torn the new country apart,"" stated President Kikwete, pointing out that this was a welcome move at the time when peace in the great lakes region was of paramount concern. The first phase of the dialogue climaxed with the Framework signing ceremony which took place at the Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge in Meru District here on Monday evening, being attended by the President of South Sudan, Comrade Salva Kiir Mayardiit and his former Vice-President, Comrade Riek Machar Teny. Others in attendance were the head of the detained leaders Mr Pagan Amum Okiech who admitted that South Sudan had lost direction due to SPLM conflicts, while both Peter Adwok Nyaba of SPLM-In Opposition and Daniel Awet Akot of SPLM in Government praised the coordination and moral support of CCM which helped to bring the two parties together in Arusha. Between the 12th and 18th of October 2014 delegations from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) family had been assembling in Arusha, deeply engaged in an intra-SPLM dialogue aimed at uniting the two factions of the split political party. CCM, which is Tanzania's ruling party, undertook the task of coordinating and hosting the South Sudan talks in Arusha with the aim of re-uniting SPLM leadership and the People of South-Sudan. The initial phase of the SS dialogue was held in frank, honest and cordial manner and after its conclusion the CCM Chairman, Comrade Jakaya Kikwete invited the principal leaders of SPLM, Comrades, Salva Kiir, the South Sudan President and Riek Machara for the official launching of the process in Arusha. As a result of the South Sudanese Civil War in 2013-2014, the SPLM party split and factionalised into the SPLM-Juba, led by President Salva Kiir and the SPLM-IO (in opposition), being helmed by former

12,3934,"Nairobi - Violence in Sudan's Darfur has surged to levels not seen in a decade, with more than 150,000 people driven from their homes this year alone. The region's long-suffering residents are also bearing the brunt of a measles epidemic. It is a conflict to which the international community appears to have no answer and which risks being overshadowed by other crises in East Africa and beyond. The humanitarian and security challenges are vast. Here's why: How did we get here? Darfur's war began in 2003 with a rebellion by tribes complaining of political and economic marginalisation against the Arab-dominated government of President Omar al-Bashir. Khartoum's counter-insurgency campaign has relied heavily on locally-recruited Arab militias who have been accused of mass killings of civilians in non-Arab areas suspected of supporting the rebels. According to the UN, the conflict has left as many as 300,000 people dead and displaced another 2.5 million. Over the years, the conflict has grown increasingly complex, with rebel movements splintering into numerous rival factions - some of which made peace, at least temporarily - and Arab groups turning against each other and the central government in ethnic disputes often linked to land rights and political power. After years of failed international peace initiatives, and the indictment of Bashir by the International Criminal Court for crimes including genocide, the conflict has intensified since 2013 with the government launching dry-season offensives against the rebels in Darfur as well as the neighbouring Kordofan region. Surging violence This year, government troops, including former militias now called Rapid Support Forces, have attacked numerous settlements in purported rebel strongholds including the Jebel Marra mountains. Recent media reports show scores of civilians sheltering in caves in the mountains, and telling of an aerial bombardment near the village of Golo in January that left an unknown number of people dead and others wounded. In May, the government paraded trucks piled high with weapons they said were seized from the rebel Justice and Equality Movement after a major battle in the Tullus area of South Darfur on 26 April. There have also been several major tribal clashes. Most recently, fighting broke out on 11 May between Ma'aliya and Reizegat tribesmen near the town of Abu Karinka in East Darfur state over a long-running land dispute. The battles reportedly left hundreds of dead and wounded and displaced thousands. The two Arab tribes have clashed repeatedly in recent years, despite mediation efforts. Hundreds were killed and thousands displaced by fighting between the two groups in the same area last year. In North Darfur state, a series of deadly attacks this year has fomented tensions between the Berti and Zayadia tribes and displaced thousands more people. Berti student leaders reportedly suspect Musa Hilal, a prominent Arab militia chief, of stirring trouble in the province. Hilal is a political rival to North Darfur's Berti governor, Osman Mohamed Yousif Kibir, who stands accused of recruiting an ethnic militia of his own. Displacement In all, about 430,000 people have been displaced in Darfur since the start of 2014, bringing the total in the region to 2.5 million, according to the UN. Some 1.5 million of those are children. About 3.1 million people are displaced in Sudan as a whole. Many internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Darfur have little prospect of returning to their homes. Aristide Nononsi, the UN independent expert on human rights in Sudan, said after visiting Darfur in May that the displaced lived in fear of armed groups and criminality. While most IDPs want to go back to their homelands, ""many interlocutors whom I met, in particular in North and South Darfur states, remain anxious about the security situation in their areas of origin... as well as the restoration of sustainable peace in the region,"" Nononsi said in a statement. The fighting around Abu Karinka reportedly saw more than 650 homes burned, and an estimated 24,000 families displaced. Hundreds more families fled with their livestock to neighbouring North Kordofan state before violence broke out, according to the UN's humanitarian coordination body, OCHA. ""The victims are in need of water, food, shelter and medecines,"" East Darfuri humanitarian aid commissioner Abdu Abdelmahmound said on May 15. According to UNICEF, the UN children's agency, more than 9,000 new IDPs had arrived in the Mellit locality alone as a result of the fighting between the Berti and Zayadia tribes. It said it was also assisting new IDPs in seven other locations in North Darfur. Assistance According to OCHA, about 1.5 million of those displaced in Darfur live in camps or ""camp-like settings."" ""The provision of basic services in these locations, relative to the rest of Darfur, is mostly adequate,"" Damien Rance, a spokesman for OCHA in Khartoum, told IRIN. ""The quality of basic service delivery however has deteriorated over the years as the number of displaced people continues to grow, fewer NGOs remain to deliver these services, reduced funding is being channelled to these services, and the political interest of the international community wanes."" Access A long-standing problem facing humanitarian agencies in Darfur has been access to vulnerable populations, particularly in active conflict zones. After the violence in Abu Karinka, for example, OCHA said humanitarian partners were standing by to move food, emergency shelters and household items. However, authorities have denied UNAMID - the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur - access to the town to carry out an assessment. ""The government has said that, at this stage, it is providing all of the aid that is required,"" OCHA's Rance said. ""The international humanitarian community stands ready, willing and able to assist."" More broadly, OCHA said that access restrictions and insecurity had prevented it and its partners from verifying the situation of 92,000 of those reportedly displaced by recent fighting, including in the Jebel Marra mountains. Food Security Militias allied with the government have long been accused of adopting ""scorched-earth"" tactics, destroying homes and livelihoods in rebel strongholds and thus contributing to high levels of malnutrition. According to UNICEF, some two million Sudanese children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition, of which 550,000 are severely malnourished and at risk of death. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which resumed work in Sudan in September after an eight-month suspension, recently appealed to donors for more funds so that it could expand its operations in Darfur. ""The ongoing conflict is still taking a heavy toll on civilians,"" said Eric Marclay, ICRC's head of operations for East Africa. ""We want to assist both the displaced and host communities directly... seed and tools are needed now to prepare for the next planting season. The additional funding will also finance medical care and the building of water and sanitation facilities."" Health According to UNICEF, frequent population displacement and high rates of malnutrition as well as very low vaccination rates contributed to an outbreak of measles in April. The disease has since reached epidemic levels in 14 states, prompting UNICEF to launch a nationwide vaccination campaign. Of the 35 reported deaths so far, 25 have occurred in Darfur. UNICEF country representative Geert Cappelaere said about 50,000 children are being deprived of humanitarian aid, including essential vaccines, in the Jebel Marra area. ""Because of conflict, we have not been able to access the population in some areas for the last four years,"" Cappelaere told Voice of America. ""So, we have there a massive group of children that are unvaccinated and may be one of the causes of the outbreak of measles we are having today."" Funding and capacity The UN's 2015 response plan for Sudan seeking about US$1 billion is just 28 percent funded, leaving huge gaps in areas including security and livelihoods assistance. UNICEF said its Sudan 2015 appeal was only 14 percent funded. Humanitarian agencies also face a vastly diminished operational capacity since the government expelled more than a dozen international aid groups in 2009. According to OCHA's Rance, the number of aid workers in Darfur has fallen from 17,700 before the expulsions to just 5,540 in November last year. ""This decline in skilled workers obviously leads to a significant capacity deficit, particularly when seen against that fact that we have seen more new displacement in 2014 than in any single year since 2004. Accordingly, the ability to deliver adequate levels of basic humanitarian services has been adversely affected,"" Rance said. Outlook The prospects for an end to the conflict appear bleak. While President Bashir, who was elected to another five-year term in April, has said he will launch a national dialogue after his inauguration, it remains unclear which members of the opposition and rebel movements will take part. Analysts and opponents say Bashir's apparent divide-and-rule policies in Darfur, which have seen the region divided into five provinces, are unlikely to change. ""These policies have destroyed the social fabric in the western region, which has led to the numerous violent conflicts between tribes, in particular the Arab tribes,"" said Yousef Hussein of the Sudanese Communist Party. ""The government now holds Darfur hostage."" Meanwhile, the UNAMID peacekeeping mission has faced accusations of timidity and of covering up abuses by Sudanese government forces and is under pressure from Khartoum to scale back its mission or withdraw completely. Reports of abuses continue unchecked. ""Our concerns run the gamut from conflict-related abuses such as attacks on civilians by government forces and sexual violence by the RSF, to indiscriminate aerial bombing on villages, and the utter lack of accountability,"" said Jehanne Henry of Human Rights Watch.

13,4139,"Juba - Scores of children seized by armed men from a village in northern South Sudan two weeks ago remain forcibly recruited as child soldiers, despite intensive efforts to locate and free them. One week ago UNICEF reported that 89 children preparing for exams were forcibly recruited as child soldiers, but the organization now believes the number of children may be in the hundreds. In addition, adult males were also forcibly recruited during the February 15 and 16 raid. Following information provided to a team of staff from UNICEF and UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism partners, UNICEF is confident that the armed group which took the children was a Shilluk Militia under the control of Johnson Oloni. This militia is aligned with the Government's SPLA forces. In an intensive information gathering exercise, both in Juba and in Upper Nile State (where the seizures took place), UNICEF and MRM partners have tried to piece together what happened during and after the raid and to discover the location of the children. A formal UN Monitoring Report of a grave violation of child rights is being prepared. One of the challenges hampering evidence gathering has been a heavy militia presence remaining in Wau Shilluk, thus making it impossible to receive first-hand information. However, from reports received so far it is becoming clear the children are not together in a single group. UNICEF understands some of the children - including some of the school boys - were allowed back into their village to eat with their parents and in some instances some children were allowed to go to school. They were then taken away again at night. In discussions with the SPLA in Melut it was confirmed the forced recruitment of the children took place and many of the children were being sent to Melut. Witnesses also stated many children have been seen in a training camp near Wau Shilluk and that in Melut children as young as 12 years old were seen carrying guns but not in uniform. The SPLA stated that the Johnson Oloni militia was outside its control. UNICEF Representative in South Sudan, Jonathan Veitch said when you put all these different witness reports together a strong picture emerged that the children may have been about to be dispatched to fight at Kaka, about forty five minutes north of Melut by boat. ""We fear they are going from the classroom to the front line,"" said UNICEF's Representative in South Sudan, Jonathan Veitch. ""UNICEF appeals to Johnson Oloni to let those children go back to school and be with their families, immediately."" Veitch also urged the Government of South Sudan to use whatever influence it had to secure the children's release.",-1,-1.0,juba scores children seized armed men fromvillage northern south sudan two

14,4347,"Yumbe - The construction of Morta Bridge, which links Uganda to South Sudan, has delayed due to shortage of funds. The Shs1.8 billion project deal was signed between Yumbe local government and South Sudan in 2013, in which the two parties agreed to equally share the cost. Mr Bernard Ayiman, the district engineer on Wednesday, said the major work remaining is laying the deck. He said the contract was for two years but now needs another year because the two countries are still soliciting for funds for the work. ""The major challenge is the cost of materials, which has gone very high. This requires reviewing the contract sum and follow up of money from South Sudan,"" he said. Mr Yasin Taban, the district chairperson, said although South Sudan authorities promised to pay the money, they have not yet done so.

15,4553,"Munich - After peace talks failed earlier this month, the ongoing conflict in South Sudan between government forces and opposition forces that began at the end of 2013 is having a severe impact on the country's food security and civilian safety. While fighting continues, widespread burning, destruction, and looting of property have aggravated the efforts of both sides to gain control of the oilfields in the north of the country. ""South Sudan is locked in a horrible cycle of conflict and abuse and there has been absolutely no accountabillity whatsoever for any of these horrific abuses,"" Skye Wheeler, Human Rights Watch (HRW) Researcher for Sudan and South Sudan, based in Nairobi, told IPS. To date, 10,000 people have been killed and two million forced to flee their homes. Aid organisations are calling this a severe humanitarian crisis. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has decried the brutal violence against civilians and children, including the burning down of entire villages and the rapes and murders of women, and children as young as seven years old, over the past few weeks. The states of Unity and Jonglei are the worst affected. It is unclear exactly who is responsible for the violence and destruction of property. An estimated 13,000 children under 15 years of age have been recruited by both government and opposition forces, an act that constitutes a war crime, not only in South Sudan but also according to international law. Another concern is the displacement of civilians and destruction of agriculture. ""People should be planting crops right now, instead they are fleeing,"" Pawel Krzysiek, a staff member of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in South Sudan's capital, Juba, told IPS. With the rainy season fast approaching, farming communities in Unity State need to plant their crops now to ensure decent harvests, something they cannot do due to the fighting. Many people have little choice but to depend on food aid. According to Oxfam, two-thirds of the population is now food insecure, with 7.8 million people in ""Phases 2, 3 and 4 of food insecurity."" The number of hungry people is projected to rise to 4.6 million by the end of July, accounting for 40 percent of the population. The rights group further estimates that 800,000 people have reached ""emergency levels of hunger, facing extreme and dangerous food shortages."" An Oxfam statement released Wednesday cautioned that this latest analysis ""was undertaken before the recent escalation of the war, so it is expected that for thousands of people in South Sudan, the outlook is now even worse."" Children have been badly hit, with malnutrition at a ""critical level"" in 80 percent of all counties in the Greater Upper Nile, Warrap and Northern Bahr El Ghazal states. Dependence on food aid will only increase now with worsening displacement - gaining access to those most in need is becoming increasingly difficult, aid workers say. ""ICRC is providing food and medicine for about 120,000 people. Many of them are displaced as a result of the fighting, which is challenging our aid workers,"" Krzysiek says. More than two million people are displaced, about 500,000 of them are completely cut off from services. Besides civilians, aid organisation now find themselves affected, with ongoing violence limiting both the options and capacity of various humanitarian groups. According to Krzysiek, medical facilities in Unity State and Jonglei State were attacked, targeted and detroyed. Aid organisations were forced to evacuate staff to ensure security. ICRC was forced to move its base from the city of Kodok to Oriny to the disadvantage of civilians. ""The hospital of Kodok is the only one in its region and therefore very important. People now have even more limited access to health services and food because of the country's insufficient infrastructure,"" Jean-Yves Clemenzo, based at the ICRC headquarters in Geneva, told IPS. Humanitarian organisations putting their operations on hold could spell disaster for the roughly 50 percent of South Sudan's 12 million who are almost entirely dependent on the delivery of aid supplies. UNICEF estimates it will distribute aid to meet the humanitarian needs of children alone to the tune of 165 million dollars by the end of 2015. Human Rights Watch is very concerned about the continous deterioration of the conflict. Over the last couple of months, dozens of cases have been documented in which civilians were arrested arbitrarily, beaten up or tortured by unidentified forces. ""It looks like we are seeing a repeat of late 2013, when government forces moved through these areas burning, looting and destroying large parts of it,"" Wheeler told IPS. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011, in a moment that marked the end of a two-decade-long war for independence, which claimed 2.5 million lives. But peace was short-lived. In December 2012 a power struggle between South Sudanese President Salva Kiir Mayardit and his then-vice president Riek Machar escalated after Machar was accused of attempting to depose Mayardit. War broke out once again on Dec. 15, 2013, and since then the world's 'newest country' has been consumed by a tide of violence. Back in March 2015, peace talks hosted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa failed. In response, the United Nations security council imposed sanctions on the country, in a resolution that threatened travel bans and asset freezes on individuals or entities ""responsible for, complicit in, or engaged directly or indirectly in actions or policies threatening the peace, security or stability of South Sudan.""

16,4775,"Juba - Britain has sent another 30 million Pounds (50 million dollars) to help South Sudanese who are suffering in the young country's conflict, International Development Minister Lynne Featherstone said at the start of a three-day visit to South Sudan. ""I am here really to look at our humanitarian effort, to visit internally displaced people, to see how things are going, to see how challenging the circumstances are that people have to live in,"" Featherstone told reporters in Juba late Tuesday. With the new injection of aid, Britain has given 125 million pounds (206.25 million dollars) to help South Sudan since the country plunged into crisis in December. Featherstone said the newly announced funds will go to international humanitarian organizations such as the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the U.N. refugee agency to help them to provide food, shelter and clean water to the 400,000 South Sudanese refugees living in camps in Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan and Kenya. The money will also be used to provide aid organizations with immunization kits, mosquito nets, kitchen sets and fuel. British aid not enough Featherstone stressed that Britain's latest pledge of aid is not enough on its own to relieve the suffering of the people of South Sudan, where more than 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes by the fighting and thousands have died. The single biggest cause, if there is a famine, is the failure of the political leadership to resolve this crisis. Speaking at a news conference last week, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Toby Lanzer, said the international aid effort for the country is only half funded, and humanitarian organizations are still waiting for $800 million to buy supplies and provide services for the South Sudanese people. Lanzer said he is not optimistic that the money will arrive in time to avoid famine in the country, where millions already face severe food insecurity and months of fighting have prevented farmers from planting crops. He warned that famine would hit South Sudan no later than the beginning of next year unless the fighting stops. ""The single biggest cause, if there is a famine, is the failure of the political leadership to resolve this crisis,"" Lanzer said. ""It is very important that people understand this is not something that a non-governmental organization or a U.N. agency or the generosity of the people in an economically wealthy country such as the United Kingdom, United States or Norway can fix,"" he said. Featherstone agreed. ""Obviously it's the leaders and the opposition in this country. They have to sort out the political situation, without which nothing can get better,"" she said. Featherstone called for an end to nearly nine months of fighting in South Sudan so that South Sudanese can return home and resume their lives, and the country can embark on development. Featherstone is expected to visit a camp for the displaced and hold talks with local and national leaders during her visit to South Sudan, which is due to end Friday.",1,0.0,juba britain sent another

17,5115,"Addis Ababa - South Sudanese former vice-president, Riek Machar, who leads a resistance movement against the government of president Salva Kiir, has congratulated the people of South Sudan on the 3rd anniversary of the country's independence, saying the celebration was however ""not joyous"" due to the ongoing seven-month war in the young nation. He accused president Kiir of plunging the country into ""abyss"" while expressing his desire that the next fourth anniversary celebration will likely be conducted in ""a peaceful federal state"" of South Sudan. The armed opposition leader decried what he said were the repeated ""ills"" which the people of South Sudan fought against for the decades, coupled with the presence of foreign troops and mercenaries which have 'undermined the hard earned sovereignty of the country.' In a press statement he issued on Wednesday, a copy of which Sudan Tribune obtained, Machar accused Kiir of putting his energy on establishing a dictatorship rather than developing the young nation, describing him as ""visionless."" ""In the last three years of our independence, Salva kiir used state power and resources to establish dictatorship and pushed the country into what has become a civil war. His visionless leadership is endangering the very future of our country. Our country witnessed nothing but dictatorship, anarchy, corruption, tribalism and lack of development and service delivery,"" Machar said in a statement at a press conference in Addis Ababa on Wednesday. ""South Sudan is now ranked a failed state,"" he said. He further accused his former colleague of fabricating a coup on 15 December in order to do away with his political opponents, adding that the ""dictator"" has now further unleashed his security operatives to 'target citizens of South Sudan who express their views on federalism in order to assert his rule."" The regime in Juba, he lamented, has divided the country and created ethnic animosity, suspicion and distrust as well as economic marginalization of the majority of South Sudanese people. He however reassured the commitment by the opposition to ""a process of reconciliation, healing and accountability in order to foster the unity of the people and preserve the territorial integrity of the country."" THE WAY FORWARD The rebel leader further expressed his appreciation to the IGAD countries, friends in the regional countries and international partners for supporting the peace process, calling on the IGAD mediation team to resume the stalled peace talks in Addis Ababa and ""review the selection of the stakeholders so that it is transparent, representative and inclusive."" He also expressed recognition of the ""great work done and role played' by United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) under the leadership of the outgoing Hilde Johnson in protecting the lives of the people of South Sudan in UNMISS camps. Machar vowed to restructure the young nation into a federal state, saying he envisioned a state in which ""never again shall a dictator be allowed to thrive nor take the country to a civil war or target any ethnic group."" He called on the South Sudanese to join the resistance movement and change the status quo. ""We encourage all South Sudanese to join in the struggle for the transformation and establishment of a democratic federal state. We regret that we are celebrating the third anniversary under the tyranny of Salva kiir. However, it is our desire that we will all celebrate the fourth anniversary in a peaceful federal state,"" he said.",0,0.0,addis ababa south sudanese former vice president riek machar leadsresistance

18,5588,"I am not a big enthusiast of ICC. I wrote an article title ""The ICC Allegations Against the President-Elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, and the Detrimental European Legacy in Africa"" in March of 2013. I am extremely against ICC inquisitives in African affairs but we do not have independence legal institutions in South Sudan, therefore, I welcomed ICC to try War Criminals in South Sudan. I would like war criminals to be isolated from their safe heaven communities that encourage them to commit crimes against humanity and individually faces justice. Introduction Feasibility or viability of any nation rests on its legal system, and South Sudan should not be exception. Nations are found upon the law. The conclusion of law is not to eradicate or confine it, but to preserve and expand freedom and justice for all citizens. Citizens of South Sudan had celebrated their independence with hopes and aspirations of enjoying freedom. In fact, states are created capable of implementing laws and state that had no law, there is no freedom. Freedom of men and women under any government is grounded in standing rule of laws for people to live by. Laws should equally apply to everyone in society, and made by the legislative power vested in it; a liberty to pursue their own dreams and aspirations. Crimes against human humanity have been committed against people of South Sudan since 1991, and reasonable consistency with laws of the state can be applied to preserve peace, deliver justice, and ensure lasting peace and reconciliations. Justice must reign to ensure complete peace and political settlement to the conflict. The wars that have been fought between North and South, and current conflict in the Republic of South have torn unity of tribes. The wounds of liberation struggles have not healed. The prejudice and tribal conflicts have not been resolved. The political rifts and diverse views among the SPLM/A leaders were never repaired. Mass killing of Shiluk, Dinka and Nuer in specific areas of South Sudan were never settled. Dr. John Garang de Mabior once called these problems Post-war or post-independence issues that would be gradually resolved after independence. Grudges of the liberation struggles are threatening unity of our country. In fact, Mayhem in Juba, Bor Town, Malak, and Bentiu, (specifically in Baliet (masscare), Jau, Panakuac Bongki, Parieng county) Piji county are threatening ethnic relationships and warranted assurance of justice to all families of victims. It is has been said that this war is between government and rebels but it had taken ethnic dimensions. Shiluk, Dinka, and Nuer were targeted for their ethnicities in their respective cities, and leaders who orchestrated these war crimes must be brought to justice. We urge International community, IGAD, moral leaders, and good people of South Sudan to join hands in pursuit of human rights and dignity of the people of South Sudan. We urge them to deliver on the core principles of the SPLM, principle of freedom, equality and justice. We all ask for fair trial and due process of the four political detainees, and ensuring liberty and freedom for citizens. Since 1983, Sudan People Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) has set forth flawless democratic ideals that brought the movement to sign the historic accords with the Republic of Sudan in Kenya in 2005. These democratic epitomes gave the people of South Sudan rights to affirm referendum, and finally declared independent in July of 2011. Although three protocols were not implemented, the key implemented protocols forged a peaceful political settlement of exceptional issues between the South and North Sudan. It was a conflict that causes death and destruction but those leaders provide a formula for peace. Those leaders knew that generations after generations were sent to war which resulted in series of tidal waves of bloodshed that still moist land of South Sudan. However, we scarified these men and women in 21 years of war to preserve endowed human dignity of our people, and moral standing at the global stage. We signed peace knowing the brutality of war and its consequences. The democratic ideals treasures in Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) have set stage for the highest hopes and dreams for all citizens. Citizens had hoped for a country that would have self-regulating institutions of government where oppositions views would be respected while majority are ruling. It is this core principle that anchored democracy, allow freedom to flourish, and guarantee opposing views which perfect governances. Essentially, people of South Sudan are naturally democrats; they were born free, and the last thing they would want to see is oppression. Their sacrificed and suffering in two decades of war warrant liberty, services delivery but negligent in part of government had created a considerable unrest in Jonglei, Unity, Warrap, Lake, and Upper Nile States before Juba's mysterious tragedy. Without shred of reservation, the citizens of South Sudan have fought, died, and bring peace that ends the longest Civil war in Africa. We have all made significant scarified whether you were part of liberation struggles or not. There is no single family that had not lost a person in South Sudan, if any than your goats, cows, maize might have been consumed by SPLA soldiers. We have all contributed to the liberation in one way or another. However, the mysterious juba's tragedy was bounded to happen. History has indicated numerous times that that political leaders that were united in the course of their struggles disintegrated after securing their independence. The United States framers wrote constitution and declared independent before they won the revolutionary. The Americans (patriots) stage successful revolutionary rebellion against Great Britain. Framers secured independence for United States, and immediately disagreement over the principles and vision of independence. Federalists and Antifederalists publicized two visions that they envision to put the United States on the final seat of civilization. The Antifederalists presented themselves as the defenders of the true principles of the revolution, and constitution, they extremely believed that federalists could establish a strong, potentially tyrannical, center of power in the new national government if they are permitted. They think Federalist could increase taxes, obliterate the states, wield dictatorial powers, favor the ""well born"" over the common people, and put an end to individual liberty. But their biggest complaint was that the constitution lacked a bill of rights, a concern that revealed one of the most important sources of their opposition: a basic mistrust of human nature and of the capacity of human beings to wield power. The Antifederalists argued that any government that centralized authority would inevitably produce despotism. Their demand for a bill of rights was a product of this belief: no government could be trusted to protect the liberties of its citizens; only by enumerating the natural rights of the people could there be any assurance that those rights would be preserved. Both federalists and Antifederalist finally agreed that bill of rightswould enshrine in the United States constitution to protect citizens from their own government. Some of my peers know that SPLM party will split and disintegrate over the SPLM vision. History tells us that this conflict within the party was predictable. It is obvious thatParty leaders' disagreement over policies of the party or of the country.Legitimate disagreement over policies that would make South Sudan more flourishing and prosperous is an important part of nations building. However, it is not clear in part of government, political detainees, and rebels what policies are they advocating? They are not certainly fighting over policies that would trigger agricultural production and accelerated development at the county levels. The government, rebels, and detainees are fighting for their jobs, election, and probably constitution. A war that should have never been fought, and people we have lost should have never been lost. You can now understand why citizens are dissatisfied of their government. Citizens Legitimate Discontent Citizens of South Sudan do have legitimate reasons to be dissatisfied with their government. Right after independent, people of South Sudan were filled with euphoria, and immediately, the government lost its way. Series of critical events and issues seemed to come in a rush, giving good people of South Sudan little time to analyze what was happening and to reflect on long-range solutions. In part of leaders, emotions seemed to replace reason as the debate grew increasingly repetitious and loud. However, what seems to have been better solution was writing new constitution to ensure viability of nation. A constitution should have been written for the benefit of next or new generation. It is something far more fundamental for the future of South Sudan. On the other hand, the government's refusal to embrace democratic transformation is now threatening foundations of the South Sudan. Writing new constitution, ending corruption, building solid institutions of governance, ensuring check and balance, and allocation of resources to counties do not simply serve the interest of particular groups, it serves the national interests. Interestingly enough, the government did not act on any policy that would at least build viable economy at least at county levels. The fact that the government presides over wide issues, and delivers no or little transpires to this crisis. Real problems that caused this crisis were economic stagnation at the county levels, unemployment among the youths especially the neglected youth of Jonglei States, Unity, Lake, Warrap and Upper Nile. The impact of disparity between the Juba elites who pay themselves millions of dollars, and poor plain folks in the villages places the country on the verge of collapse. Poverty and starvations caused youth to raid nearby communities of their cattle. Pseudo institutions build in Juba to quench financial satisfaction of elites in are threatening nation's foundation and progress. The vast majority of South Sudanese question legality and validity of institutions that do not perform their basic functions. For instance, South Sudan Legislative assembly does have a solemn duty to investigate key leaders in the presidential guards, killing of journalist, and cattle raiding in the various states. They were elected by people and they must secure interests of citizens. The inability of legislature to perform its basic functions undermines impartiality and check and balance lurk the viability of nation. Certainly, a carefully calculated corruption, uncontrollable killing and cattle raiding in Unity, Jongeli, Lake, Warrap and Upper Niles States, and not one case was prosecuted by the judicial branch of government escalated political and ethic turmoil in the country. The president exercises extraordinary influence over the nation Supreme Court and the Legislature to the extent that he singlehandedly pardon 75 officials that took millions of dollars. Hence, what was criminalized in the constitution was now officially decriminalized by the president. Besides, he relieves governors and replaces those with those who are loyal to him. The epidemic behaviors of the president simply mean that all the state governors and state ministers must be loyal to him or they could be fired; clear autocratic mentality that is destined to cause violence. Even after violence that had claimed thousands of lives, millions of dollars lost and cities lay in ruins, the president clings to his repressive policies. He asked the prosecutor to investigate the political detainees, and availed their final reports to him. Which country where does this happen? This is constitutional breaches. It violated the constitution, and removes the impartialities of the court, and suggests that only one branch of government exists. If the president does not allow the national law to take its course, what would Murle, Nuer, and Dinka youth do in their communities? The Minister for information, Makuei Lueth in the South Sudan political parties Symposium, declared four political detainees as ""criminals that would be charged for treasons."" Televised over all the world, the president press secretary, Ateny Wek tours of Eastern Africa countries campaigning and advocating that there was coup d'état in Juba. The above examples indicate Kiir's administration is incompetence and his officials possess ineffective skills of leadership. South Sudan is nation where renowned scholars and people of various professions hailed from, yet our nation continues emasculate by indifferent leaders. How can the president and the South Sudan Legislature ensure judicial impartiality in this case after meddling in their case? How can we restore our image around the global that we are a nation governs by laws? The moment case of the four political detainees was reported to the president, and demand maximum prosecution resulted into judicial miscarriage. The president aborts legal process, and undermines our nation ability to prosecute criminals. Another, clear indication that there is no check and balance in government of South Sudan. I certainly agreed that crimes have been committed, and justice for victims and accountability must be ensured. Leaders who orchestrated this tragic war must be brought to justice. I will mention them in part that discusses (War Crimes and potential or possible convictions). ""Allege Attempts Coup D'état in Juba"" Political and legal Ramification of mysterious Juba's tragedy continues to haunt South Sudanese in South Sudan and around theglobe. Even after three months, not a single official in the government had a gut to demand for the truth. The South Sudan constitution grants member of legislative assembly ability to investigate as to what caused conflict in Juba but they have shown no will to do so.Yet, the war that broke out on December 15th, 2013 sap life of out of South Sudanese, and brought the country nearly to its knees. The government officials have been pounding into people heads that this was a coup attempted by political detainees, and other officials that had worked for government had suggested that this was disagreement among the presidential guards. However, there are no compelling reasons or evidence that indicates that coup was plotted. There was no evident that shows president Kiir's home, or him was almost captured. The soldiers loyal to the president, Salva Kiir and the former vice president Dr. Riek Machar fought bitterly for almost four days. Riek Machar fighters in those four days had no leader (they were not led by individual with ranks in the SPLA; they fought in those four days without a leader that gives them directions. The fact that the government of South Sudan did not identify individual with ranks that was leading fighters in Juba between December 15th to 19th, 2013 make it difficult for anyone to believe that there was a coup plan. The Infamous Supreme Court Trial for Political Detainees This infamous court trying the four political detainees in the course of the last few weeks is damaging our moral standing that Global stage because the government 'senior officials convict political detainees before trial. This court is proving that the political detainees were found guilty before due process.However, universal legal standard or international judicial system pronounces that all the suspects are innocent till proven guilty by the law. This infamous trial in Juba is affirming that we are lawlessness state when this should be an opportunity to repair our image and moral standing at the global standing, since this is a televised trial. The framer of South Sudan constitution, Justice Makuei Lueth asserts that ""we do not have political detainees, we have criminals in jail."" This is an episode that makes world leaders dizzy because it implies that this is premeditated, and South Sudan government is simply prosecuting innocent politicians. The prosecutor had failed to establish links between the fighting that took place in the presidential guards at army barracks at Giada and Bilpham on December, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th, 20013, and the political detainees. We all know the command and control in the army. The presidential guards are led by Major, and Brigadier Generals. The president and his officials agreed that the war broke out in the Presidential guards. The Prosecutor did not even bother to ask what caused fighting in the Presidential guards. Why does the prosecutor refuse to scrutinize generals that lead presidential guards, who else will know what caused fighting or violence in the presidential guard? They need to identify people who first fired the bullets, if they have failed to identify leaders in the army, and why are they keeping innocent people in jail and tried? It vital that presidential gurads generals have managed to arrest people who killed innocent people in Juba but it will remain a mystery if they do not reveal men and women who initiated fighting in the military headquarters and arrest in Juba. The IGAD, International community and most importantly people of South Sudan are waiting to hear compelling evident, and well supported facts of coup d'état in Juba, otherwise, we all assume that this is kiir's maladministration work at its best. Poor judgment and miscalculation could have caused fighting in Giada. However, the government officials have insisted that the four Political Detainees will be charged for treason, if they are founded guilty. The prosecutor has carried its interrogations and came up with the following charges against: the General Oyai Deng Ajak, former SPLA Chief of Staff and security Minister, Oyai was one accused of coup d'état. Dr. Majak D'Agoot a martyred eminent South Sudanese politician and Director of National Security and Deputy Defense Minister, Majak have been accused of coup over six times. The Chief Negotiator of the CPA Pagan Amum OKiech, it is importance to note that Mum has bitterly disagreed with the President on the implementation of the CPA protocols, championship for nominee for the SPLM party in 2016 election, and contest over the SPLM chairman, Ezekile Lol Gatkuoth, head of GoSS mission to United States was placed in jail because of his tie to Washington. These most revered, honored and cadres were accused of alleged coup d'état and charged with the following: i. Incitement of the masses ii. Causing disaffection among police or defense forces iii. Defaming the government of South Sudan iv. Undermining the authority of or insulting the president If the above charges are true, they do not carry treason penalty or 20 years in prison, I think they were written for publicity. I have engaged in those charges because I have undermined his authority, and insulted him. How many people have insulted the president? I think they are part of legitimate discontent across the nation because president has failed its people. Whenever, the president failed citizens demand accountability and justice. Besides, our bills of right guarantee freedom of press and speech to criticize our government wherever its goes wrong. Political detainees did not incite violence or caused conflict. The political detainees did not stage a coup but they were put in prison for political reasons. The senior government officials understand that these giant politicians and military leaders could undermine kiir bit for presidency comes election in 2016, hence they orchestrated and cooked ways of eliminating them. They saw that setup them up for coup was the best and it work for them, and I am not sure how this coup will sustain Juba's leadership. We, in the diaspora are embarrassed about each new development in our country. We all had hoped that the government would setup independent body to investigate into Mayhem in Juba, Bor Town, Bentiu, and Malakal, however, the government is paying more attention to case of four political detainees. What evident that links political detainees with fighting that broke out in the presidential guards? The Supreme Justice fails to provide answer. The violence seems to stem from disagreement among presidential guards. The long brewing volcanic eruption instantaneously rages in three key states because conditions and situations there exacerbate conflict. The government officials know very well that our country is fragile; we just emerged from wreckages of wars fought for six decades. The environment and climate of South Sudan is ethnically tense and political charged, and an opportunist likes Dr. Riek Machar took advantage of such situations and helps killed thousands innocent people. On the other hand, Juba's fails to assess what it has been doing wrong, and history indicates that good leaders I identify where they went wrong (identify problem, define problem, and frames policy that could potentially remedy those problems). We have witnessed deliberate inefficient or incompetent leaders who have failed the people and killed hopes and dreams of South Sudanese instantly. Kiir administration political miscalculations and poor judgment plundered the country into grim of war. Kiir's Administration Tragic's Policies There is no country that has survived when its leader it rigid. President Kiir stuck with ill advices that come from his inner circles or President of Uganda (and tribes in Uganda are completely different from our tribes). Therefore, policies of Ugandan government will never and can never be feasible in South Sudan. He listens to advices of those who are ill informed about policies of independence which frequently resulted into tragic events. Ill policies have killed people of South Sudan, and I hope this will be lesson learnt. Since 2006, president Kiir has been championing the appeasement policy. He appeases militias, and integrates them into the SPLA forces. Kiir integrates militia starting with deputy chief of Staff, Paulino Matip Nhial to recent Lt, Generals Bapiny Monytuil and Johnson Olony. He offers Presidential amnesty. This is sound good in media and in part of the president but appeasing people whose loyalty remains with rebels and not South Sudan nation is harmful and had claimed thousands of lives in this war. Appeasement policy reward rebels for their killing and violence behaviors. Appeasing peter Gatdet Yaak is tragedy of common. Besides, the president should have known that Dr. Riek Machar wanted to be leader since 1990s through rebellion, hence appeasing Dr. Riek Machar was a receipt of bloodshed. However, the government first needs to accept that mistakes were made, and this war did not sprung overnight. We must stop blame games and cease from being in the denial. It is inhumane and unthinkable to kill entire generations for meaningless war. However, death level in South Sudan should fare well with criticism of government and rebels. Both rebels and government are equally responsible for this violence. The administration is confused and had no clear policies of mitigating conflict and responding to mounting international pressure. From 2007 to 2013, President Kiir has been championing containment policy. He initiated this policy when he removed his vice presidential powers, fired the vice president and reshuffles entire cabinet, events that worried the IGAD, International Community and good people of South Sudan. People who observed the government of South Sudan for the last years could agree that Kiir policies were bound to transpire into strikes riots or violence. RIGIDITY, APPEASMENT AND CONTAINMENT were policies have resulted into graving consequences. We must have justice as a prerequisite for a viable peace. I will propose a clear road map to peace and stability. I know lot of people across South Sudan will not be happy with this article but victims will have hopes with my propositions. We have had monolithic government for the last 9years, and I think factions in the government perfect democracy, and they create check and balance. The president kiir had presided over wide arrays of issues that transpire into this tragedy. Deep seated hatred has been growing among citizens, and he singlehandedly allows ministers to sip luxurious wine in Juba. Death and displacement at these scales would dictate any conscience to see for justice and accountability. In fact no one would brush off the worst destruction of lives and let go criminals free. Hence, I recommend war criminals must be held accountable. Rally Justice for the Victims It is essentially cornerstone and core principle of the International Community, IGAD and good people of South Sudan must continue to call for justice. South Sudan must never be a country where leaders killed their own people and go unpunished. We have rewarded Dr. Riek Machar for mass murdering in Twic East, Duk, and Bor South in 1991. We have rewarded David Yau Yau for committing atrocities in the state of Jonglei (Uror, Fangak, Twic, Bor South, Twic East Duk), and we have rewarded Peter Gadet Yaak for killing innocent people in Greater Upper Nile region before this war broke out. For how long shall we continue to reward criminals for killing innocent civilians? The leaders that I have mentioned above have been widely considered as individuals who orchestrated ethnic cleansing in South Sudan. Because we rewarded the, they have been living in a state of denial. They are not aware of the crimes they have committed. First, whatever the twisting and distortion of cleansing are, the fact remains that ethnic cleansing is defined according to article 2 of the convention on genocide as ""any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group, (Article 2, 2002 Convention on Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing) With that said, in which way is the Killing of in Bor Town, Juba Bentiu , Baliet, Bongki, Jau, Pariang County Leer, Piji County and Malakal are not a Ethnic cleansing? Nuer tribe is killing Dinka. Is that not a killing of group which according to the above definitions amounts to an act of ethnic cleansing? Also the killings, raping and indiscriminate attack against the innocents' civilians bring them mental harm. Is that not also acted of cleansing according to the above definitions? Patients were raped and killed in Bor Town and Malakal Hospitals isn't the true definition of ethnic cleansing? Besides, the displacements in which the victims find themselves in a surrounding which they have not anticipated cause mental harm. Furthermore, depriving the victims of their chances of making opportunities for their lives such as displacing them from their farms so that they no longer grow crops and rear their animals fit perfectly the ethnic cleansing definition of "" inflicting on groups conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" Make no mistake, we do not need a large number of people to die to classify a killing or harmful action as an ethnic cleansing. Even if one person is being killed, it's ethnic cleansing as long as the killer intends to eliminate that person because of his/her tribe, and ethnicity. In short, an intention to eliminate a person because of tribe, and ethnicity can amount to act of ethnic cleansing even if the elimination has not yet succeeded. Only justice can deter criminals in South Sudan. They will continue to kill but we will threat them with justice. This is a blue print, and evidences in on sites findings will authenticate these definitions of ethnic cleansing....Killing innocent people ought to end, and it must end now. I am not a big enthusiast of ICC, I wrote an article title ""The ICC Allegations Against the President-Elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, and the Detrimental European Legacy in Africa"" in march of 2013. I am extremely against ICC meddling in African affairs but we do not have independent legal institutions in South Sudan, therefore, I welcome ICC to try War Criminals in South Sudan. War Criminals must be Tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC) I urge the International Community, ICC, IGAD, moral leaders, and people of South Sudan to stand together and press war crimes charges against the perpetrators, and mastermind of this bloody war and previous conflicts. I affirmed that South Sudan will remain stable and peaceful when justice starts to roll down and takes its course. The impartial justice system can provide victims with necessary resources to rebuild their lives. Furthermore, the justice system often provides victims and their families with a sense of justice that South Sudan, IGAD and International Community could provide. I will list some generals below that could be held accountable for crimes against victims or state.Nevertheless, the court could possibly grant victims to file lawsuits against responsible parties, or leaders implicated in crimes, and the court could determine which case it could drop or consider base on its own discretions. The court could rather attempts to ascertain whether an offender or liable for the injuries sustained as a result of the crime. Victims must be compensated or reparation, they should be awarded because they have lost everything they had. Victims must be fully compensated for the trauma of victimization or the loss of a loved one; it can be a valuable resource to help crime victims rebuild their lives. Criminals must be exposed to crimes liability. Investigators can be allowed to visit several sites where mass killing reported mass.Besides,in this politically charged atmosphere and climate, it raises prospect of distortions and biases that could affect human rights investigations. The report describes alleged incidents of mass killings in Juba, Bor, Bentiu and Malakal. In these capital cities and counties, Rebels forces were said to have engaged in targeted killing of Dinka civilians in houses, hospitals and Churches. Many series of independent reports suggest that Nuer were targeted and killed in Juba, streets and in their homes. In Bor Town victims were tied together in lines and forced to walk to locations where they were then killed, the report recounted. Rebels and government have committed serious human rights abuses. UN personnel reported that that hundreds of bodies of those killed in Bor have been ""burned, buried or thrown into the River Nile. Eye witnessed affirmed that over 200 people were killed in the hospital, and church, most of them were ill old women and men. Dinka and Shiluk civilians were killed by the Nuer ""white army"" and by defectors from the army and police in Malakal, according to the UN personnel reports. As control of Malakal shifted, attackers focused on civilians belonging of different ethnic groups. When the Rebels controlled Malakal, Dinkas and Shilluk were targeted; when government forces were in control, civilians of Nuer said to have been targeted because they were seen as supporting the opposition. Now, thousands of citizens are in dire situations. Nobody exactly the number of people that have died but the carnage continues on a broad scale of destruction. People continued to receive sad news of their loved killed, some are either killed, rape or maimed. My findings indicates or alleges that these leaders were implicated in war crimes committed in Juba, Bor Town, Malakal, and Bentiu, (specifically in Baliet massacre), Jau, Panakuac, Bongki, Parieng county) Piji county and notes that more leaders could be added in this list: 1) Dr. Riek Machar Teny, the former vice called on all the SPLA generals to overthrow democratic elected government. This calls is described an as an inciting of violence and perpetration of massacre killing. He establishes South Sudan Resistance Movement (SSRM) which validated rebellion and affirmed his intends to kill innocent people in all regions of South Sudan. 2) Marial Chanuol, Major general of the presidential guards and led the Juba killing of Nuer ethnic groups. He led Juba mayhem against Nuer ethic group. UN personnel have reported that 200 to 300 people of Nuer ethic group were killed between 15th, 19th of 20013. 3) Peter Gatdet Yaak, major general who mastermind Bor tragedy in Malual Chaat and Pariak.

19,6265,"Mingkaman - Hundreds of women displaced from Jonglei to Lakes state by the conflict in South Sudan say that they have been living without sanitary towels and other basic hygiene-related items for the past three months. ""I am not producing anymore, but there is need to have those things that I may not mention to my son. Many young women are here with us, they have been facing the same problem since we came. We feel shame when we come to public places like this. Why are our needs [are] not considered? We need such things very soon"", said Achol Arok Dut, who spoke on behalf of the women in Minkaman camp. Dut is one of the 92,000 people who are displaced in Lakes state. Most of whom have fled from neighbouring Jonglei state and are seeking shelter in Minkaman, Kalthok, Ahou and Yolakot in Puluk payam (district) of Awerial county. A number of women gave birth under trees but never got any clinical help with her children said that she also needed health care or at least a health hygiene kit including underpants, soap, towels, and sanitary towels. Sudan Tribune spoke with Ayen Marial and Adut Bolek who gave birth under trees in the Yolakot IDP camp. ""I was in labour for two days here under the tree before I had my baby son, I was helped by my mother. No baby soap or body lotion, I never got a chance to visit my health center since I came here"", Adut Bolek said. Ayen Marial gave birth to triplets who all weighed less than two kilograms. A young girl working for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) explains to women how the items in the hygiene kit should be used in Yolakot on 27 February 2014 (ST) The Catholic Relief Service (CRS), an American charity, is now providing hygiene kits alongside shelters for the displaced people in the three locations of Yolakot, Ahou and Kalthok in the Puluk payam [district]. For the last two days, officials responsible for distribution said they covered over 400 households, expressing their willingness to push for another up to 4,000 households. The United Nations estimates that 710,600 people have been displaced inside South Sudan since the conflict began in mid-December. A further 171,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries. In Minkaman displaced camp 16,650 people received oral cholera vaccines, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in South Sudan. The UN's Crisis Response Plan is 20 percent funded, with $748 million of the $1.27 billion needed already pledged. The funds need to be raised so that lifesaving supplies can be put in place ahead of the rainy season that begins in March, when most of the country becomes inaccessible by road.",-1,-1.0,mingkaman

20,6394,"Khartoum - The Sudanese 2nd Vice President, Hassabo Mohamed Abdel-Rahman, met on Wednesday with the outgoing United Nations (UN) special representative for South Sudan, Hilde Johnson. Sudan's official news agency (SUNA) quoted Johnson as saying following the meeting that the UN relies heavily on Sudan to deliver humanitarian assistance to the people of South Sudan besides contributing to resolving the ongoing conflict in the newborn state. She pointed that Sudan is a pivotal and important country in the mediation between warring parties in South Sudan, saying it can play major roles in the search for a solution to the crisis. Johnson added the armed conflict in South Sudan led to the suffering of many people due to acts of killing, violence, and chaos, pointing that 1.3 million people have been displaced outside of their areas. ""We rely heavily on Sudan to deliver assistance to the affected population through land, river, and air transport"", she said. The UN official noted that she paid several visits to South Sudan neighboring countries in this regard, considering Sudan the most important country to South Sudan. She pointed that her meeting with the vice president discussed the humanitarian assistance and the need for establishing air bridges and channels between Sudan and South Sudan to deliver aid to the needy. Johnson underscored that the vice president expressed Sudan's commitment to facilitate her mission, expressing hope that Sudan plays major role in helping its newborn neighboring country. The violence in South Sudan has forced tens of thousands to seek shelter in United Nations camps for protection. The six-month-old conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 1.3 million. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that 79,700 South Sudanese have fled to Sudan. But government reports in Khartoum put the number at 22,700 people, saying the newcomers join their relatives who stay in open areas in the Sudanese capital, as well other areas on the city outskirts. According to a recent report issued by the World Food Program (WFP) on the regional impact of South Sudan crisis, more than 86,000 South Sudanese have arrived in Sudan since mid-December. The report noted that relocation of South Sudanese refugees to the three sites in White Nile State is complete, warning these sites may not be sufficient if the situation deteriorates further and the influx continues. It added that Sudanese authorities are in the process of identifying two additional sites to resettle new arrivals, projecting that 165,000 new refugees from South Sudan will have arrived by the end of 2014. Last April, the UN office in Sudan disclosed an disagreement between the UNHCR and the Sudanese government on the description of the South Sudanese citizens who fled to Sudan due to the ongoing conflict in the newborn state. Khartoum since the start of South Sudanese crisis refuses to describe them as refugees saying they will be considered as Sudanese citizens and are free to settle where they want, but at the same time it refuses to establish refugees camps near the border fearing that rebels seek refuges there.",-1,0.0,khartoum sudanese 2nd vice president hassabo mohamed abdel rahman met wednesday outgoing united

21,6812,"Bunj - In the Yusuf Batil refugee camp in South Sudan where the number of new infections of the liver disease hepatitis E was once regularly between 200 and 500 hundred a week, public health efforts by the UN refugee agency and its partners have reduced the spread of the illness to four or fewer weekly cases. The outbreak of the disease coincided with a new wave of refugee arrivals from Sudan's Blue Nile state during the summer of 2012. Hepatitis E, which is linked to poor hygiene and sanitary conditions, is transmitted through unwashed hands and water and food contaminated by fecal matter. As a first response, UNHCR and humanitarian agencies re-doubled their efforts to provide sufficient levels of safe drinking water as well as an adequate number of latrines equipped with hand washing stands. ""Today, water access for refugees across all camps is at 22 liters per person which means sufficient quantities of water to cover an individual's daily personal and domestic needs,"" says Adan Ilmi, UNHCR's head of office in Maban. ""Similarly, latrine coverage is one latrine for every 17 persons."" In order to ensure that the sanitations facilities were properly used and hygienic practices were adopted, a comprehensive public awareness and education strategy was immediately implemented in the areas' four refugee camps. At the centre of their efforts, community health workers and hygiene promoters taught the refugees about the importance of hand washing. Frequent demonstrations on the use of soap or ash have been supported by the regular distribution of soap blocks, the monitoring of latrines for cleanliness, and the promotion of latrine use and the avoidance of open defecation. Doro is Maban Country's most populous refugee settlement with 46,600 inhabitants. It is congested and during the rainy season prone to flooding that can render latrines in certain areas of the camp unusable. While the reconstruction and rehabilitation of some of these latrines is ongoing to stem the transmission of hepatitis E and other water borne diseases, UNHCR is also working on a strategy to remove and relocate over 10,000 refugees from Doro's flood prone areas. The transmission rate of hepatitis E in Doro peaked last summer at between 50 to 80 new cases weekly. Today, as a result of the rigorous hygiene campaign, the number of new cases now averages 16 individuals a week. ""Now that the messages on good hygiene practices have been disseminated and understood, agencies are working to ensure that things like hand washing become second nature and a daily part of refugees' lives,"" says Evalyne Nyasani, a water sanitation and health (WASH) specialist with UNICEF, a sister UN agency working with UNHCR to provide support on response mechanisms in refugee situations. Behaviour change has been one of the major challenges faced by health workers in Maban's refugee camps, says Nyasani. Misuse of prescribed treatments, the preference for traditional remedies over conventional medicines and deeply rooted cultural practices have all made efforts to tackle the disease more difficult. ""We have understood the messages from the agencies but some of the communities still believe that hepatitis E is from God,"" says thirty year-old Asha Osman who lives in the Doro camp. ""Because of this they don't always take the information seriously, claiming that God will stop the disease."" Though the incidence of hepatitis E is now dramatically reduced, the efforts of UNHCR and its partners to promote good hygiene continue. Refugees will not just be the recipients of the messages on sanitation, says UNHCR's Ilmi, they will also be active contributors to their dissemination. ""Refugees now have a better understanding of the fact that their hands are vehicles for transmitting good or bad health outcomes,"" he says. ""Hand washing is a small but essential practice that will prevent them from contracting hepatitis E and other illnesses, but ultimately the decision to do it rests with them."" As of this month, more than 11,000 cases of hepatitis E cases have been recorded in Maban's refugee camps with 241 people having died as a result of the infection.",1,0.0,bunj yusuf batil refugee camp

22,6844,"Juba - The UK plans to send a second evacuation flight for its nationals in the South Sudan capital, Juba, on Friday as fighting continues to spread throughout the country. Civilians arrive to seek shelter at the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) compound in Jonglei capital Bor on 18 December 2013 (Photo: UNMISS/Reuters) The Foreign Office has advised its nationals wishing to leave to be at the airport by 10am (local time). No baggage is permitted. After initially advising against travel to Jonglei and Juba, the Foreign Office upgraded its advisory on Friday, warning against all travel to the country. ""We strongly advise all British nationals in South Sudan to leave the country if they can do so safely. You may have difficulty leaving in the event of a further deterioration in security"", the Foreign office said in its revised alert. The Foreign Office has temporarily withdrawn some staff and dependants from the British embassy in Juba amid increasing security fears. The British embassy in Juba remains open, but is running at limited capacity. The Foreign Office has warned that security constraints and reduced staffing may make it difficult for the British government to provide consular assistance in the event of a further deterioration in the security situation. The UK's first evacuation flight from Juba arrived in Uganda late Thursday. A fourth US evacuation flight also took off from Juba on Thursday headed for Kenya, with Italy and Germany also evacuating their nationals. The US state department said it was also offering an additional evacuation flight for its citizens on Friday. The US announced on Tuesday it was temporarily suspending its embassy operations in Juba, with all non-emergency diplomatic staff ordered to leave. The Australian government, which does not have resident diplomatic representation in South Sudan, has urged its citizens to leave via commercial flights. It has also upgraded its advisory for South Sudan to 'Do Not Travel' due to the ""extremely dangerous"" security situation on the ground. The situation in Juba remained mostly peaceful on Thursday, with the government making assurances to UN agencies and foreign embassies ""that civil tranquillity has been fully restored"". However, the conflict continues to spread throughout the country, with Jonglei state capital Bor now under the control of rebelling South Sudanese army (SPLA) forces, while 16 people were killed when

24,7725,"With peace talks set to open between the South Sudanese Government and warring rebels, senior United Nations officials in the country are urging all parties in the conflict to protect civilians amid the ongoing fighting and to allow relief workers safe access to them. Briefing the press in Geneva today, Jens Laerke, of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), referred to a statement by Toby Lanzer, Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, who said that over the previous two weeks, violence has driven some 200,000 people from their homes and has indirectly affected many hundreds of thousands of others. In response, aid agencies are scaling up their work, especially in towns which had seen struck by violence and in rural sites where civilians had sought safety. ""The largest site of civilians was in Awerial, Lakes State, where up to 76,000 people have gathered,"" he said, adding that agencies are providing food, non-food items and basic healthcare there, and are stepping up efforts to make clean water and latrines available. Fresh fighting in the world's newest country erupted on 15 December when President Kiir said soldiers loyal to Mr. Machar, dismissed from office in July, launched an attempted coup. Mr. Kiir belongs to the Dinka ethnic group and Mr. Machar to the Lou Nuer, and the conflict has been increasingly marked by reports of ethnically targeted violence. Thousands of people are estimated to have died in the violence, and among those that have fled, many are seeking refuge on bases of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which has been authorized by the Security Council to almost double its armed strength to nearly 14,000 in an effort to protect civilians. Representatives of President Kiir and Mr. Machar are due to meet in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, according to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the East African bloc that is mediating the talks. Mr. Laerke said that the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan has called on all parties to facilitate aid agencies' access to civilians, and to protect and respect humanitarian activities, workers, and property at all times. In the meantime, humanitarian partners in the strife-riven country have issued a plan which will enable increased assistance to the most severely affected people. It also aims to help those that have left Sudan and sought refuge in South Sudan's Unity and Upper Nile states. The plan includes provision of protection, water, food, shelter and healthcare, Mr. Laerke said, adding that overall, it targets some 628,000 people over the next three months, and agencies will need $166 million from international donors to implement it. Mr. Laerke recalled that yesterday, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos, briefing reporters in New York, expressed deep concern about ongoing reports of disturbing, gross violations of human rights, and the lack of protection of civilians in South Sudan. Ms. Amos had stressed that aid organizations needed access to affected communities to provide healthcare, shelter and clean water. ""People's lives depend on this,"" she had said. Mr. Laerke noted that OCHA's planning took into consideration that the number of internally displaced persons might double in the coming three months. On other fronts, UNMISS, reported yesterday that it continues to protect around 57,000 civilians across the country. It also reported a drop in the number of civilians at its Malakal base and Bor base. The numbers have been fluctuating in recent days. In addition, UNMISS said that 246 police officers from two Formed Police Units have deployed to South Sudan to strengthen security and order for civilians seeking refuge inside its bases. A medical team from the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) arrived today in Juba to bolster support at the UN Juba bases. Logistical support for air operations is being provided by the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO. In a New Year message to the people of South Sudan, UNMISS chief Hilde Johnson said Wednesday that both the leaders of IGAD and the United Nations were calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the release of all political detainees, political dialogue and humanitarian access. She called on the parties to take decisive steps for peace. Ms. Johnson also emphasized that all violence must stop, and warned against the risk of a cycle of violence between communities in South Sudan. She said that accountability for grave human rights violations will be essential to prevent this cycle of violence, and reported that the Mission's human rights teams continue to gather evidence for use in future accountability measures.",1,0.0,peace talks set open south sudanese government warring rebels senior united nations officials country urging parties conflict protect civilians amid

25,8134,"President Kiir says help is underway for 223,430 victims of heavy floods in seven of the country's ten states. Mr. Kiir was speaking to reporters at a press conference this morning, where the severe floods that are ravaging the country, was the sole focus of the presidential address. ""Your government is deeply concerned with the suffering imparted upon you by this natural disaster and has taken immediate action towards finding temporary mitigation measures, while also looking for long term solutions once we overcome the emergency situation,"" Kiir said. Last week the cabinet approved 7 million SSP for the supply of shelter, water purification tablets and medical services to affected population. A fact-finding taskforce, composed of nine ministers, mapped out the flood affected areas and briefed the council of ministers last Friday on the impact of the disaster.

26,8345,"Khartoum - Sudanese government would give a written response to the accusations of support to rebel groups that Juba filed to the African Union, a member of the joint security committee in Khartoum said on Sunday. The announcement was made by the rapporteur of the joint security committee from the Sudanese side, Al-Moez Farouq, following a meeting with the members of the African Union Ad Hoc Investigative Mechanism (AIM). The three member African body handed to the Sudanese side the accusations received from Juba over Khartoum's alleged support South Sudanese rebels led by David Yau Yau in Jonglei state. Farouq said the visiting mechanism will transmit the reply of the Sudanese side and the recommendations of the joint security committee to the African Union commission and the African union High Level implementation panel for Sudan and South Sudan (AUHIP) chaired by Thabo Mbeki. In statements to the official news agency SUNA, he stressed that they will give a written response to the accusations raised against Sudan. He further added that the South Sudanese members of the joint security committee will arrive in Khartoum on Monday. The Sudanese official who described the meeting with the African mechanism as ""very important,"" told reporters that the meeting with the visiting AIM members tackled all issues and concerns presented by Sudan. He also pointed out that the committee will visit some areas where Sudan and South Sudan mentioned in their complaints of support to rebel groups. For his part, AIM member told reporters they felt the seriousness of the two parties to reach a solution, emphasizing that this would allow to make some proposals to resolve disputes between the two parties. The Sudanese army's chief of military operations, general of division Eimad Adawi, on Sunday reiterated Sudan's commitment to cooperate with the African investigation team which is expected to terminate its works within six weeks. ""We are committed to whatever mechanisms approved by the African Union and we will work with all parties,"" stressing that the security arrangements are the key step for the establishment of good-neighbourly relations and cooperation between the states of Sudan. On 22 July the African Union Peace and Security Council launched the investigation body as Sudan threatened to stop the follow of South Sudanese oil saying Juba continues to support the Sudanese rebel groups breaching the Cooperation Agreement of September 2012 and the implementation matrix sealed in March of this year. Faroqu said that two delegations of the security committee will hold a meeting on Tuesday chaired by the directors of intelligence services. The South Sudanese delegation chaired by the director of the SPLA military intelligent Maj. general Paul Mac Bol will arrive to Khartoum on Monday. Also, South Sudanese foreign minister will be in the Sudanese capital next week to prepare an official visit of the South Sudanese Salva Kiir to visit Khartoum by the end of the month to discuss the security issues which seem the first concern for Sudanese officials and other pending issues.",0,0.0,khartoum sudanese government would givewritten response accusations support rebel groups juba filed

27,8929,"Juba - President Salva Kiir Mayardit presented his new cabinet structure to South Sudan's 10 state governors on Thursday and asked them to also downsize their own administrations at state level. During the meeting at his office in Juba, president Kiir asked for there to be more cooperation between state governors and federal ministers in order to deliver basic services. Kiir said the main reason for reducing the size his cabinet was so that more money could be channeled to support development projects. The number of ministers and deputy ministers has been reduced to from 58 to 31. This includes the president, minister in the office of the president and the still-to-be-appointed new vice president. According to a broadcast on state-run South Sudan Television Kiir called on South Sudan's governors to help him restructure and strengthen the local offices of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). It remains unclear as to how governors can be directly involved in the restructuring of the ruling party as some of them do not have control of the local structures in their areas. ""It was very important meeting. We went as the governors to the president to congratulate him on the formation of the new cabinet and to declare to him our support and the support of our people"", the governor of Central Equatoria state, Clement Wani Konga said in a statement broadcast on Thursday evening. He did not elaborate on the call by the president seeking the reduction in the size of state cabinet and no separate official statement was released by the governors. CABINET TO BE REFERRED FOR APPROVAL The structure of the new cabinet will now be referred to the national parliament for study and approval, while the office of the president will manifest itself in two ""executive institutions"", shared between himself, two ministers in his office and vice president who has not been named. Ministries unchanged in the restructuring include justice, defence and veteran affairs, foreign affairs and international cooperation, national security, a ministry in the office of the president, vice president office, health among others. The ministries of information and broadcasting and telecommunications and postal services have been combined into one ministry of information, broadcasting, telecommunication and postal services. The ministries of agriculture, forestry, cooperatives and rural development and fisheries, animal and resources have been combined into one ministry of agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries. The ministries of education and higher education have been merged into one ministry of education, science and technology. The ministry of transport and the ministry of roads and bridges were joined to create the ministry of transport, road and bridges. The ministries of environment and mineral resource, water and forestry were combined into one ministry of environment, water and natural resources. The ministries of land, housing and nairobi metropolitan were combined into one ministry of land, housing and urban development. The ministries of sports, national heritage and culture were combined into one ministry of sports, culture and the arts. The ministry of interior has been combined with wildlife and conservation. The ministry of finance and economic planning has been restructured to include commerce. The ministry of environment has been merged with the ministry of petroleum, industry and mining.

28,9426,"The African Union Summit on HIV-AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria tagged ""Abuja + 12"" has come and gone but it does appears the controversy engineered by the ""wanted"" Sudanese leader, General Omar Al-Bashir's presence on Nigerian soil will continue. The meeting had been called by the African Union, AU to seek ways of closing the 50 per cent gap in funding the fight against malaria. Al-Bashir came here to participate in the AU Summit and Nigeria being host country was in no position to decide for the AU who to attend and who not to attend. I think Dr. Emeka Anyaoku, the former secretary- general of the Commonwealth, has made this point very clearly. The controversy on Al-Bashir arose against the background of two warrants issued for his arrest by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009 and 2010. Al-Bashir is being accused of committing war crimes over the conflict in the old Sudan's Darfur Province. Critics of Al-Bashir's visit to Nigeria, who are made up mainly of activists and human rights groups had called for his arrest and handover for trial by the ICC. A similar advocacy had been made in the course of visit of Al-Bashir's visit to Uganda last year. As to be expected, that country's leaders ignored the cacophony championed especially by the BBC. Such has been the effect of the ICC warrant that General Al-Bashir hardly goes anywhere without evoking these kinds of negative sentiment. Three main reasons account for why Nigeria did not have to affect the foreign leaders' arrest. One, as already cited above is that Nigeria was not in a position to determine who attended the Abuja + 12 Summit because the AU was the convener. Second is that the AU, of which Nigeria is a frontline member, had discounted the arrest warrants on Al-Bashir on the conviction that the ICC was unfair and discriminatory. The AU has since formally rejected those war crimes charges. Nigeria is of course bound by all resolutions by the AU. The third reason Nigeria had to ignore the pressure to embarrass the Sudanese leader with arrest may have been political. Foreign countries, particularly Britain and the United States which have been outspoken on the issue, as well as the European Union, EU, including the Human Rights Watch are merely preaching hypocritical values. The US along with Israel are not signatories to the ICC charter. But America which has never accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC nevertheless continues to exercise significant influence on the ICC. The U.K and the U.S. are notorious for turning their backs on international agreements and resolutions of the UN whenever in their own perception, their national interests are at a stake. What moral right do they have to seek to force Africans to act against a fellow leader on account of far less atrocities than they have committed elsewhere? Take the invasion of Iraq for instance. The U.K. and the U.S. lobbed missile after missile on military and non-military targets and made sure that the UN Security Council was reduced to no more than an onlooker as they carried out the greatest assault ever on an independent state. It was clear from the beginning, and until the end of the Iraqi war that there were no weapons of mass destruction held by Saddam Hussein. Where is the justification for the destruction of that country, and the killing of hundred of thousands, perhaps millions of people? Consider also the well-documented roles of two world leaders who played frontline roles in this war, to wit Blair and Bush. The two were so committed to this private war of their's that neither of them needed domestic approval which -they could not have obtained - nor that of the UN, on account of which they chose a dubious sobriquet - the ""coalition of the willing"" as the vehicle for the war. Did the ICC ever contemplate the trial of Blair and Bush? Another EU giant, France under successive leaders, backed Bouteflika in Algeria to first of all deny victory to a legitimately and democratically elected government of Islamists, and then went on to wage an endless war that officially claimed 63,000 citizens. Where was the ICC in Algeria?Why are they silent on France and Bouteflika? As if to prove that neither the U.S. nor Europe believe in the virtue of restraint, they just pushed the Army to throw out yet another democratically elected government, Morsi's government in Egypt. Who knows what Egypt is going to turn out into as a consequence? Russians are already predicting a civil war. Then, talking about the Russians. Who dare questions them about the goings-on in Chechnya? Does anyone care about the outrightly blatant refusal of Europe to cooperate in the arrest of war criminal, Milosovic? Based on these alone, it is important to note that the Nigerian government, which foreign policy seemed to wobble from time to time, gained traction and commendably stayed the course by resisting those pressures. But besides all of these hypocritical virtues by those pushing for the arrest, Nigeria has her own national interest at a stake. I am sure it is for those interests that our leaders sent troops to help keep the peace in Darfur, while the U.K. and the U.S. did not. In Sudan as it currently exists, there are no less than five million Nigerians who have made that country their home. There are parts of their capital, Khartoum you will go and think that you may have missed your way into Kano city. If Sudan should throw those people out, they would destabilize not only Nigeria but the neighboring Chad and Cameroon. This is no ancient history. Nigerian groups that jump at an idea because it is fanciful need first of all to know what constitutes their own national interest. Unless they know it, they cannot rise to its defence whenever a foreign country tries to assault it. As citizens of Nigeria and of Africa,our activist groups will have the support of well-meaning country folks if they focus on bringing the administration of our country and the rest of the continent up to international benchmarks. Of course this is easier said than done. But when they see hypocrisy and double standard as in the case of Sudan, they must fight it with equal vigour and passion.",-1,-1.0,african union summit hiv aids tuberculosis malaria tagged abuja 12

29,9595,"No one whether locally or internationally can still argue there is more hope to resolve Abyei stalemate peacefully. It has been everybody's wish that dialogue could prevail over wrangling and peace over war. But all the well wishers, South Sudanese and Sudanese of good will are put to shame by intransigence of some of ruling elites in Khartoum. For many peaceful options were suggested and equally exhausted that resulted in failed negotiated settlements. These were Comprehensive Peace Agreement, CPA that devoted one of its protocols on Abyei referendum in tandem with that of Southern Sudan in 2011, Abyei Boundary Commission, ABC whose findings were rejected by Khartoum, The Hague Court of Arbitration whose ruling remains gathering dust on the shelves due to Khartoum refusal to implement it. Then, came Khartoum invasion of Abyei in response to its alleged provocation by Juba in the run up to independence declaration. The whole world weighed in to resolve the crisis, urging both side to establish the Abyei joint administration and keep off the area militarily, but Khartoum refused the proposal while Juba has ever since been begging the AU and UN to either sweet talk out or flash out Sudan armed Forces all in vain. This resulted in recent out bust by President Kiir in accusing the two bodies of bias. That is true because when South Sudan was allegedly invaded and took over the oil field of Heglig, the whole world was on her neck while condoning the same invasion and takeover of Abyei by Sudan. Khartoum has not only taken over the urban parts of the disputed territory, but further urges Miseriya Arab to drive out the Ngok Dinka from their remaining ancestral rural land. One of these atrocities is recent cold blood murder of Ngok Dinka paramount chief, Kuol Deng Kuol not in his own house, but in the hands of AU peace keeping troops who supposed to protect him. If such atrocious killing could not jolt AU and UN into action, then what else? The gruel act has caused President Salva Kiir Mayardit and all concerned patriotic South Sudanese to question the AU/UN's motive of lulling us into deep sleep while Miseriya are busy ethnically cleansing Abyei of all Dinka Ngok people over night. The same concern has made leader of Minority party, SPLM-DC in parliament, Honorable Onyoti Adigo to propose the transfer of Abyei to a neutral administration run by UN and AU so that Abyie referendum takes place in October as planned. This is normal procedure in UN system whereby two rival groups over a disputed territory are asked to vacate it in order for a peaceful referendum to take place whose verdict shall be respected by both sides and problem solved once and for all. It happened in colonial times back in 1940s - 1950s and recently it was the case in Estimore, Indonesia and Kosovo. Then, what is unique about Abyei's issue which is even more genuine and complicated to attract action than that of Estimor and Kosovo. Unlike Ngok Dinka with Arabs, Estimoris are from the same Asiatic race with Indonesians as is the case with Kosovars and Serbians. My own proposals: Due to Khartoum's intermittent failure to listen to the voice of reason, South Sudan government should redirect its efforts in the following alternative avenues: One, issues an ultimatum to Federal Republic of the Sudan to withdraw from Abyei within specific time frame for UN-AU to take over and organize a free and fair referendum as scheduled. Two, failure of which it shall tantamount to declaration of all out war by Sudan against Republic of South Sudan. Three, South Sudan should by now begin sending troops and essential relief items for the returning Ngok Dinka to Abyei. Four, due to austerity biting government and everybody, all South Sudanese citizens in and abroad should be asked to contribute whatever they have, be it Dura, clothe, fair of shoes, money, medicines, etc. as part of general efforts towards an impending war with the Sudan. I proposed all the above simply because Sudan is gravely exploiting vulnerability of South Sudan. This vulnerability is in form of our dependence on Sudan as our main supply route for cheaper consumer goods and source to which our oil pipelines are connected besides our current economic depression. All these weak points have made South Sudan beholden and slave to Sudan. Therefore, it is high time for South Sudan to choose between food and her dignity. Now it is up to the South Sudan to assert sovereignty by relocating her business interests to neighboring East Africa and like Jews leaving Egypt never to look back again. Or failure to do so, South Sudan shall remain deprived of her valuable territories through black mails by using food and oil pipelines, confined in an abject poverty and virtually bartered at will. South Sudan is land birthed out of our nakedness and nothingness and what brought her into being was our sheer determination to be free and honored in the community of nations that cherishes freedom and sovereignty as the only means to an end: material needs. And those who may say they are too hungry to fight for their right, like Fidel Castro who opened leeway to Cubans clamoring for cheap life in the west, President Kiir should allow them to leave South Sudan alone and freely for anywhere of their own choosing. These terrorists, who burn innocent children, old women and men in their sleep in Abyei, need to be taught one or two lessons as they so wish. Of course they may go to Arab cousins in the Mideast, urging them to wage a holy war against us. This is nothing new. As for us there is nothing holy about an exercise that snubs life out of human being. Which was why South Sudan won the war full and square because what they call holy, God's spirit was not with them anyway. These are just bunch of terrorists hiding behind all the glorious terminologies of God they can lay their wagging tongues on. In response, we must call up on the west to help us so that the next phase of fighting the Sudan as terrorist state of her likes has begun in earnest. Sudan is hell bent on denying us peace and development she jealously enjoys. Deng Vanang: Journalist and Executive member of South Sudan official opposition, SPLM-DC. He can be reached at: NB.

30,9665,"On the eve of the second anniversary of South Sudan's independence, the top United Nations envoy there today commended the progress made so far while also noting the many challenges facing the young nation such as tackling insecurity, addressing human rights violations and strengthening public institutions. South Sudan became independent from Sudan on 9 July 2011, six years after the signing of the peace agreement that ended decades of warfare between the north and the south. Over the past two years, the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has been assisting the country in consolidating peace and security and helping to establish conditions for development. ""Many of us witnessed the outpouring of euphoria that greeted the dawn of independence of South Sudan. The mood of that day now seems like a fading memory,"" Hilde F. Johnson, the Secretary-General's Special Representative and head of UNMISS, told the Security Council in a briefing via video-link from the capital, Juba. ""We have since seen many setbacks and problems, and tensions with Sudan driving decisions that were challenged by many, including this Council,"" she added. Progress to date includes improved relations with the Sudan, the internal dialogue with armed groups, and a renewed commitment to advancing the national reconciliation process. At the same time, a key challenge is the security situation in Jonglei state, where fighting between Government forces and armed groups has displaced thousands of civilians since January. ""The deterioration in the security situation in parts of South Sudan has been accompanied by human rights violations by both armed groups and national security institutions. National and state authorities are struggling to translate their commitments to improve respect for human rights into action,"" she stated. ""Cases of arbitrary arrest, detention, abuse and incidences of killings by security forces, as well as the inability of the authorities to hold those responsible to account, are cause for deep concern."" Echoing the call made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his latest report on South Sudan, Ms. Johnson urged the Government to establish effective, long-term strategies to address the underlying causes of perennial violence. She added that UNMISS continues to support the Government's efforts to seek political solutions to inter-communal conflict and peace initiatives aimed at bringing durable solutions to disputes over scarce natural resources. ""The Mission is encouraging local authorities, community leaders and national figures to reinforce their efforts to foster reconciliation. It is also essential that national and state authorities, and the communities themselves, take the lead and assume full ownership of such processes."" The Government has also faced difficulties in implementing political reforms and strengthening public institutions, Ms. Johnson noted, adding that bodies crucial to a successful political transition require adequate budgetary support from the Government to advance their work. The key determinant for developments in South Sudan, said the envoy, remains its relations with Sudan. Noting setbacks such as counter-accusations by both sides of military support to rebel groups in each other's territories, and the threat by Sudan to shut down the oil pipeline, Ms. Johnson said both countries should strengthen their cooperation towards peaceful coexistence.",0,0.0,eve second anniversary south sudanindependence top united nations envoy today commended progress made far also noting

31,9791,"Wau - Senior officials from South Sudan's Western Bahr el Ghazal on Sunday rejected claims arguing that the state's administration had done little to sensitise the local population about the benefits attached to the cabinet's decision to relocate the headquarters of Wau County. John Peter Miskin resigned as the Commissioner of Wau County over the announcement in October and in December protests against the move were dealt with violently by police killing a number of people. Twenty protestors were killed in demonstrations on 8, 9 and 18 December, according to government figures. Former commissioner Miskin, however, has claimed that the true death toll was much higher. Further violence in Farajallah village, located in the Bagari district, 48 miles from Wau town, claimed the lives of 26 innocent people, all members of Dinka ethnic group from the three different states of the greater Bahr el Ghazal region. Bagari is the proposed new location of Wau County's administrative headquarters On 24 December, South Sudan's President and the Governor's of Warrap, Lakes and Northern Bahr el Ghazal all visited Wau to try and calm tensions and back the decision to relocate the headquarters. Since the turn of the year local leaders have attempted to rebuild peace between their communities. The Balanda community, who live in Bagari have distanced themselves from the killings which took place in the Farajallah area on the district. South Sudan's ruling party - the SPLM - has long advocated ""taking the town to the people"" by providing services in rural areas. According to Western Bahr el Ghazal's Security Adviser, Rizik Dominic Samuel, ""there is nothing which the government did not do"" to make citizens aware of the reasons behind the transfer. ""All efforts were exerted to sensitise community members. Specialised committees were formed and carried out their tasks. There was a committee on security headed by myself. There was a committee on peace and reconciliation headed by comrade Effesio Kon Uguak, as an adviser on peace and reconciliations. We all traveled and held series of meetings with different groups of people in Bagari,"" Samuel explained in an interview with Sudan Tribune on Sunday. Samuel accused some people ""with special interests"" of instigating the protests, which led to the deaths of the 20 protestors and the killing of 26 innocent civilians in Farajalah. ""It is not that the issue of relocation of Wau County was not understood. Our people know very well that the government has a clear policy which gives priority to taking towns to our people in the rural areas so that rural-urban migration is reduced by taking services to them. This was why cabinet sat and decided to relocate county headquarters"", he said. The official further explained that the decision of the cabinet to relocate the county headquarters was not only meant for Wau County administrative headquarters, but would also affect Jur River County. ""There were two county headquarters in Wau town. There was Jur River and Wau. Jur River County received the cabinet decision and moved to Nyinakok but people with special interest in Wau County instigated youth to protest. They refused to attend dialogue meetings. So it is not correct that the government did not educate local population about importance of the transfer"", he said Some of the state's politicians had a problem accepting mistakes, he said, adding that the earlier problems are raised the easier it will be to resolve them. ""Most of the failures come from people who have a habit of making excuses. Our people seem to have developed [a] mentality that makes them think that their own failures to differentiate common interests from individual political differences is made by other people. It is high time they stop blaming others for their own failures. If you do your own assessment, you will find that most people are good at making excuses, at blaming others for their own failures. Excuses are the tools a person with no purpose or vision uses to build great monuments of emptiness"", he explained. JOURNALISTS ARRESTED Two state journalists have been arrested in Wau following the failure of the state broadcaster to show a speech by Kiir when he visited Western Bahr el Ghazal on 24 December, Reuters has reported. International press freedom watch dog - the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) - said in a statement that the arrests were probably a campaign to stop the media from investigating the recent violence. Authorities have been concerned by a video passed on to Al Jazeera television that appeared to show the police firing on unarmed protestors on 9 December in Wau town, local journalists told CPJ. Security agents have attempted to pressure reporters in Wau to find out who had provided the footage to the international media. Western Bahr El Ghazal state's minister of information, Derrick Alfred Uya, however, claims that the senior state reporters were detained over ""administrative issues"", referring to the failure to broadcast Kiir's visit in December. ""They were arrested simply because when the president arrived here in Wau on December 22, 2012, he gave a very, very important speech,"" Uya told Reuters. The detained journalists are Louis Pasquale, director-general of the state broadcaster in Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Ashab Khamis, director of state television, according the CPJ. Tom Rhodes, CPJ's East Africa Consultant said in a statement on Friday: ""We call on authorities to release Louis Pasquale and Ashab Khamis immediately, and allow journalists to cover events in the state without facing intimidation or arrest."" The arrests in Wau comes almost exactly a month after the assassination of Isaiah Ding Abraham Chan Awuol, a regular political commentator in the South Sudanese press and on online forums, including Sudan Tribune. Awuol, who was known in his writing as Isaiah Abraham, was a vocal critic of Salva Kiir and his government. Two arrests have been made in relation to Awuol's murder, which family and friends of the late writer say could have been conducted by elements related to South Sudan's security forces. The 18-month old nation has struggled to accord its citizens the freedoms fought for during decades of civil war. Last year, a newspaper was closed down after it criticised President Kiir for allowing his daughter to marry an Ethiopian. Many South Sudanese journalists complain of persecution at the hands of the security services. Despite former rebels - the SPLM - governing South Sudan since 2005, the country operates with no media laws, leaving media groups and journalists unsure of where they stand in terms of libel, red lines and other issues. Press freedom groups note that South Sudan government and security services are largely made up of veterans from the civil war who are not used to scrutiny. In the 2011-2012 press freedom index, Reporters Without Borders ranked South Sudan 111th out of 179 countries.",-1,-1.0,wau senior officials south sudanwestern bahr el ghazal sunday rejected claims

32,9898,"The Ministry of Interior has donated two Land Cruiser vehicles to the Uganda Police Force (UPF) on 22nd June, 2012. The convoy that left Juba Monday 21st June, 2012 for Nimule was led by South Sudan Police Service (SSPS) Director for Administration Maj. Gen. Joseph Lado Lako and Director for Rescue Force Brigadier General, Abraham Albino and Police spokesperson Col, James Monday. Speaking during the handing over ceremony the Director for Administration Major General Lako who was representing the Inspector General for South Sudan Police said that, they went to Elegu town in Ugandan side of the border with S. Sudan with directives from IGP General Acuil Tito Madut in order to donate the two vehicles to the People of Uganda. Maj. Gen. Lado said the donation came as a result of a joint integrated highway patrol mechanism signed in Numule on 16th June, 2012 between IGP Gen. Madut and Uganda IGP Gen. Kale Kayihura. ""This donation shows that peace is prevailing among the people of the two borders (Nimule and Elegu)"". Lado thanked the representative of the Uganda IGP for the warm welcome. Meanwhile the Police spokesperson, Col.James Monday stated that, the donation was a token of appreciation to the people of Uganda. Monday mentioned that the two Generals have signed a joint integrated highway mechanism in Nimule, for a joint patrol which has started to maintain security between the two borders. He said the purpose of the joint mechanism is to ensure security between Nimule and Uganda.

33,10192,"Juba - President Salva Kiir Mayardit has directed the Governors of South Sudan's ten stated to conduct extensive public lecturers to explain the benefits of the cooperation agreement he signed on 27 September with Sudanese president Omer Ahmed El Bashir, apparently in an attempt to diffuse tensions and public criticism over the deal. On Tuesday South Sudan's parliament ratified the agreement despite receiving mixed reactions including protests from MPs from Northern Bahr el Gazal State, who reject the inclusion of the Mile 14 in the demilitarized border zone between the two nations. The buffer zone security map was put forward the African Union High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) who are mediating between the Sudan and South Sudan, which gained independence in July last year. The protests have taken place despite the location of the buffer zone, according to AU and UN Security Council having no bearing on the final demarcation of the border or the status on contested areas. However, leading government officials and civil right activists who are from the Dinka Malual ethnic group in Northern Bahr el Ghazal have rejected the deal as Mile 14. The critics of the deal say that Mile 14 was never mentioned in the any previous deal between Sudan and South Sudan or on the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The CPA paved the way for South Sudan to vote to separate from Sudan last year. Protestors also argued that the area was not part of any claimed or disputed areas included in the post referendum and now secession disputes. The deal allow But President Kiir and his negotiators have countered that the deal is just a temporary security arrangement and called on state governors to help him explain it in simple and comprehensible language to the citizens so that they understand the benefits which the deal brings to the country. This comes days after the president held a close door meeting with governors of the states. Madut Dut Yel, Deputy Governor of Northern Bahr el Ghazal attended the meeting on behalf of Governor Paul Malong Awan, who was the first and highest ranking official to reject the deal. Yel returned to Aweil, capital of Northern Bahr el Ghazal on Wednesday with Kiir's message. Speaking to cabinet members on his arrival at Aweil airport Yel said that he told President Kiir ""that our people are not happy with inclusion of the 14 mile area in the safe demilitarized buffer zone because it lies deeply inside our territory south of [the] Kiir River but the president said the agreement was just a temporary security arrangement."" The deputy governor added that ""the meeting equally agreed and directed the state governors to conduct extensive education and explain to the citizens in order to remove fears and worries relating to security arrangements and four freedoms which appear to have generated a lot of concerns from members of the general public"". Pagan Amum Okiech, the South Sudan's lead negotiator at the talks on Thursday evening said in a televised statement on South Sudan Television confirmed that President Kiir had directed his ten governors to educate their citizens. ""Demilitarization of the 14 mile area is one of the areas of concerns among the people of Northern Bahr el Ghazal State. These concerns have been addressed. The governors have endorsed it and they will now go and explain it to the citizens. ""Civic education would remove worries that have been developed of either misunderstanding or confusion caused by people who have not read the agreement and confusing the security arrangement with the status of disputed and claimed areas"", Amum explained. President Kiir on Wednesday in high level meeting with different level of various groups and prominent political leaders from the area said his administration would never give away an inch of area's claimed by the new nation to Sudan. Amum, who is the Secretary General of South Sudan's ruling party, said that the deal was a prerequisite requirement for the resumption of oil production and exports to the international markets

34,10746,"Bentiu - The governor of South Sudan's Unity State, Taban Deng Gai, denied on Friday an allegation from Sudan's security services that they intercepted him having a phone conversation with Sudanese rebels groups operating north of the international in South Kordofan State. Khartoum's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) on Thursday claimed that Gai had been coordinating with with the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) to attack a Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) base in Khrasana, as part of the ongoing border conflict between the two nations. In a statement released Thursday, JEM military spokesperson, Badawi Mosa Al-Sakin, claimed they defeated the Sudanese troops in two positions in Kharsana near Heglig. ""Let them prove my talking with the rebellion group in Sudan. Are they bugging officials phone number[s] in the republic of South Sudan? If so, does international laws give them that right in hacking a sovereign nation?"", Gai said. South Sudan split away from Sudan in July last year as part of a 2005 peace deal but many key parts of it were not implemented including demarcating the oil-rich borders and resolving grievances in South Kordofan and Blue Nile where the SPLA-North fought as part of the SPLA - know South Sudan's army - during the civil war. Since the SPLA-North began fighting Khartoum again last year, Khartoum has consistently accused Juba of assisting its former colleagues north of the border. Juba denies this but the Small Arms Survey research group argues that despite the denials Juba and Khartoum are both almost certainly supporting each other's rebels as proxies. The UN, US and others have all called on Juba to stop backing the SPLM/A-N, which in November of last year joined with JEM and the two main factions of Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdel-Wahid Mohamed Nur (SLM-AW) and Minni Minnawi (SLM-MM) to form the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) vowing the overthrow the government. Since late March the two nations have fought over the disputed oil field of Heglig, with the SPLA holding area for 10 days before announcing a pullout of the area on Friday. However, Sudan's Minister of Defence Abdel-Rahim Mohamed Hussein announced that his forces evicted the SPLA from area. This photo of Sunday, April 15, 2012, shows a soldier from the Darfuri rebel group Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) at a South Sudanese position in Heglig, South Sudan. (AP Photo/Michael Onyiego) Khartoum has accused JEM fighters of collaborating with South Sudanese army (SPLA) based in Unity State in the Heglig attack. On April 15 a photo taken by an Associated Press journalist in Heglig showed evidence that JEM soldiers were present at a South Sudanese position in the disputed area. However, on Friday the Unity State governor told Sudan Tribune that Khartoum's allegations were lies - an attempt to smear South Sudan as a new sovereign nation. Gai said the Sudanese president OmerHassan Al-Bashir's recent rhetoric - describing the SPLM as ""insects"", vowing to remove them from power in South Sudan and teaching the country ""a lesson"" - as undiplomatic. The Unity State governor also called on the people of South Sudan to ignore Sudan's claims that the SPLA's withdrawal from Heglig has been forced by the Sudan Armed Forces. Gai said Friday that SPLA forces were still deployed beyond 23 kilometers north of disputed Heglig town. SAF BOMBING The Unity State governor accused the Sudanese Armed Forces of killing over 75 people in his state using of MiG 29 fighters and inaccurate Antonov bombers, where bombs have to physically thrown out of the back of the plane. Gai said that the SAF bombings inside South Sudan are retaliation for the SPLA's capture of Heglig on the 10 of April, which Juba claims was in response to SAF attacks on the oil-rich state. The UN, US and others have condemned the bombing of Unity and Warrap states in recent days but SAF continues to deny it has done so. With the SPLA's pullout of Heglig Khartoum has said that Juba will be held responsible for any damages to the area's oil facilities. Before South Sudan's occupation of the Heglig it had supplied around half of Sudan's oil production. A Sudanese official on Friday said that 40,000 barrels a day from Sudan's normal 115,000 had been lost due the Heglig's capture. Due to the haste which the pumps were turned off, regardless of any other damage, it will take some time to resume production. On Friday Gai repeated South Sudan's allegation that SAF was bombing the oil field and that it was not to blame for any damage - a position South Sudan is likely to stick to when negotiations between the two sides resume. It is unclear when this will be. Juba has said it is ready for talks but Khartoum is yet to indicate it is ready to return to the table. However, it appears that when talks do resume, the ownership of Heglig and compensation for damage to Heglig's facilities - two new issues - will now be on the agenda. Despite announcing the SPLA withdrawal from Heglig on Friday South Sudan's president had previously laid out the circumstances under which he would order them to pull out; assurances that Heglig not be used a base to attack Unity State; UN peacekeepers deployed there until its status could be resolved; and SAF's withdrawal from neighboring Abyei - another disputed region. Sentiment in South Sudan, borne out by numerous protests over the last week, has been largely angry at the international community and the head of the UN Ban Ki Moon in particular for their criticism of Juba's position. The demonstrators pointed to numerous acts of ""aggression"" committed against South Sudan and SAF's occupation of Abyei since May last year, accusing the international community of being harsher on Juba's nine-month-old government than they have been with Khartoum. A local woman on Friday told Sudan Tribune that colonial power Britain should be invited by the international community to demarcate the north-south border as it was the UK long with Egypt that granted Sudan independence in 1956 along with the hotly contested border. Gai, who fought the Khartoum government as part of the SPLA during the civil war (1983-2005) said Sudan's ruling National Congress Party (NCP) were ""full of lies and murderer[s]"".

35,11124,"""U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Opening of the Inaugural Women in Public Service Institute, Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts. MS. BOTTOMLY: It is my distinct pleasure to introduce a woman who Wellesley College has long been proud to call one of our own. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Wellesley class of 1969, is the 67th U.S. Secretary of State. She is only the third woman to hold this position, but the second Wellesley alumna to do so. (Applause.) Her public service career has spanned 40 years as an attorney, a first lady, and a senator. And as an advocate for human rights, health care reform, and issues pertinent to women and children. At Wellesley, Secretary Clinton was a political science major who became the first student to address her peers at commencement, a tradition that has been honored ever since. (Applause.) Secretary Clinton spends many hours a day traveling to all corners of the world, and so we are delighted that she could join us at Wellesley today for the opening ceremonies of the first Women in Public Service Institute. Madam Secretary, I know the Women in Public Service Project is close to your heart, and we thank you for being the champion of this important initiative. You are a role model to women everywhere and you continue to make your alma mater proud. Please join me in welcoming back to Wellesley, Hillary Rodham Clinton. (Applause.) SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Oh, good morning. It is wonderful for me to have this opportunity to be here with all of you. I want to thank President Bottomly for her introduction and for understanding that the education of women does not stop at the campus's edge or even a country's border. This event, being held for the first time here at Wellesley, would not have been possible without the commitment and leadership of all the so-called sister schools, including Barnard; Bryn Mawr; Smith; Mount Holyoke; Scripps College, who's president Lori Bettison-Varga is here today, and we just expect this to continue growing and going from strength to strength. There are many longtime friends here in the audience and distinguished leaders, young and young at heart, from around the world, but I am particularly pleased that you just had a chance to hear from my friend and predecessor both at Wellesley and in the State Department. I've had apparently a habit of following in Madeleine's footsteps, and I have to say it always does work out for the best. So thank you so much, Madeleine. I also want to thank some of the people who have made this extraordinary idea become a reality: Rangita de Silva-de Alwis, who is the director of the 2012 Women in Public Service project; Ambassador Melanne Verveer, our ambassador-at-large for global women's interests, who you will hear from later in the program (applause); Farah Pandith, who is my special representative to Muslim communities around the world, a graduate of Smith College and a strong advocate for this program (applause); and Kavita Ramdas, chair of the institute planning committee. I want to thank not only all whom I have mentioned, but all the speakers and mentors who are contributing their time and expertise throughout this first Women in Public Service Institute. It's an extraordinary collection of talent and wisdom, and I envy all of you who will be given the opportunity to sit on every session and listen to every panel. And most of all, I want to recognize the 50 young women who have traveled here from around the world, not only to participate, but to share their own experiences, to give us some sense of the challenges and opportunities that they see before them, to acquire some new skills and some new friends. And many come from countries in transition across the Middle East and North Africa. And you are among the young people transforming a region and inspiring the world. Now we are looking to you for your leadership to turn the promise of change into real and lasting progress that moves each of your countries toward democracy, human rights, and opportunity. And no matter where you're from, we're all here today because we believe in your potential, and we are committed to your futures. We're here because we feel the call to public service, to work together, to solve problems, to improve lives, and because we are convinced that the women of the world have so much to contribute. Now, I could not think of a better place to launch this institute than here at Wellesley. I have so many memories from my time here: swimming in the lake - (laughter) - sometimes legally, sometimes not - (laughter); staying up late in my dormitory talking to my friends, sometimes arguing about everything from art and politics to what we were going to do for dinner that night; being told by my French teacher that, Mademoiselle, your talents lies elsewhere - (laughter). It was a humbling experience. I came here at a time of great upheaval in America. The years of my time at Wellesley coincided with protests and war, by inspiring movements for social change and by devastating riots and assassinations. The experiences of that era not only changed us but also changed Wellesley. We used to say that Wellesley was a girls' school when we started and a women's college when we left. I learned a lot from my time here. This is where I first felt the call to public service, the imperative to get off the sidelines and try to make a difference. After all, this college's Latin motto urges us """"Not to be ministered unto, but to minister."""" And it was here that I began to gain the confidence and the skills to get involved, to pursue new and different ways to solve problems, to speak up, to be heard. And that's what this Women in Public Service Project is all about. You've begun your own personal journey. And in some cases, you've had to overcome challenges that certainly my classmates and I never dreamed of. You will get to know each other over these next weeks, but I've been reading your bios and being very impressed. There's a young woman from Afghanistan here today, Naheed Farid, who, like millions of other girls in her country, lived for years under the repression of Taliban rule. They burned her school and all the books. But Naheed persevered. And after the Taliban were overthrown she went on to earn degrees in law and political science. She became a human rights activist. She even ran for office. And now at 27, she is the youngest member of Afghanistan's parliament. Naheed is not alone. There's a young woman here from South Sudan, Jackcilia Ebere, whose family had to flee when civil war reached their village. Now she's back home, helping build the world's newest nation as both a civil society activist and a public official. Every one of you has your own story of challenges overcome and barriers broken, because all over the world, women still face obstacles to political and economic participation. Cultural traditions, legal barriers, social pressures stop women from pursuing an education or starting a business or certainly running for office. And there aren't enough mentors and role models. And there are too many extremists of all stripes trying to constrain and control women: how we dress, how we act, even the decisions we make about our own health and bodies. Now, the numbers on participation tell the story. Women hold less than 20 percent of all seats in parliaments and legislatures around the world. I'm sorry to say, here in the United States, our percentage is even a little lower, at 17 percent. And it's not just politics. Only 3 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women. And I always think to myself: What a waste, because the world cannot miss out on the talents and contributions of half the population. But these numbers tell only part of the story. We need better data and more rigorous research that documents the impact women have on in public service and the obstacles that still prevent us from contributing. To begin this work, the Women in Public Service Project has given an initial grant to the University of Albany for field research in Uganda and an initiative to form a new caucus for women legislators there. And we look forward to expanding on this kind of effort in the future. Around the world, we are hoping to help correct the gender imbalances in public service, not just by working at the top, shattering those glass ceilings, but also at the grassroots level by training and supporting women like those who are here, who have the talent, who have the will, but sometimes not the opportunity to become effective leaders in their nations. Now, I know how daunting it can be to get started. When I first arrived on this campus in the fall of 1965, I was acutely aware of my own limitations. I didn't think I was smart enough or worldly enough to succeed here. I called home and I told my parents I didn't think I should stay at Wellesley. And my father immediately said, """"Well, then come home."""" (Laughter.) """"Go to school near home."""" But my mother, a women who had been abandoned as a child and had to fight for everything she had in life, said, """"You cannot quit. You must persevere. You must go on."""" And of course, she was right. And I grew to love Wellesley and to test myself against limits that I experienced and then to try to go beyond them. I remember a classmate of mine wrote a poem about this process we were all going through. And she said, """"It is well at every given moment to seek the limits in our lives, and once those limits are understood, to understand that limitations should no longer exist."""" The year 1968 was particularly tumultuous. I remember going with a friend to what was then the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to Grant Park, where there were riots and confrontations with the police. I'll never forget the smell of teargas, the sight of night sticks and rocks slicing through the air, the sound of protest chants mixing with frightened screams and angry shouts. Now, that was just one day, and I got to go home to my safe life once it was over. But over the last year and a half, as protests and revolutions have swept the Middle East and North Africa, I've thought back to that experience in Chicago. And when I talk to young activists, whether they be from Egypt or Tunisia or Yemen or Libya or Jordan or anywhere in the region, I'm reminded that our yearnings for human rights and human dignity, for justice and opportunity, are truly universal. And for those of you who have been on the front lines of these struggles, who have tasted the gas and felt the beatings, and who are now working to shape and secure your transitions to democracy, I express great appreciation. It can be difficult, however, to move from protest to politics. And in my conversations with young activists, I've heard many questions about how to make that shift, how to organize, how to hold a new government accountable, how to run for office. Those are crucial questions because truly, in a democracy, protecting that democracy becomes the duty and responsibility of every citizen. History shows that all too often, the victors of revolutions can become their victims and that new autocrats can derail progress toward democracy. So it is up to every citizen, men and women alike, to resist the call of demagogues, to build coalitions, to keep faith in the future of the system you are building even when your candidates lose in the elections. And as women, you have a special stake in the outcome, because we have seen that women's rights and opportunities can hang in the balance. And we know from experience that women's contributions are vital to building successful democracies and thriving societies. This can be an incredibly frustrating process. After the riots and assassinations of 1968, my classmates and I wrestled with whether political action is ultimately worth the pain, the struggle, the compromise. But I realized that despite our disillusionment, it was ultimately the only route, in a democracy, for peaceful and lasting change. The class of 1969 eventually decided we needed a student speaker and they asked me to speak at our graduation ceremony. And one of the things that I said was, """"The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible."""" That is what I hope you learn to do here at the Women in Public Service Institute: to make what seems to be impossible, possible. I remember being in Cairo last spring, meeting with men and women who had been leaders of the protest in Tahrir Square. And I asked them, """"So now, are you starting to organize for politics? Are you beginning to think about how to put together coalitions to run candidates for office?"""" And I'll never forget one young man said, """"That is not our job. Others will do the politics."""" I said, """"Oh, excuse me. If you do not participate, then others will hijack your revolution. And they will - (applause) - very often begin from the first day to undermine the hopes and aspirations that you were protesting for."""" Over the coming days, you will work with leading experts and academics, and have the chance to build these relationships that can give you additional insights. You'll hear from a wide range of women leaders from inside and outside government, women who have organized social movements and civil society organizations, who have started businesses, run for office, and defied the odds throughout their lives. And each of you will be paired with a mentor who will stay in close contact with you after you return home. There will be seminars on practical skills like how to move legislation through a parliament or hold a press conference, sessions on how to organize grassroots networks and how to lobby public officials, discussions about major challenges like increasing women's participation in peace negotiations and post-conflict decision making. I'm very pleased that Dell computers is one of our sponsors, because each of you will be given a laptop loaded with software and tools for grassroots organizing and networking. And Dell is also providing training on how to use social media and other connection technologies for effective advocacy and communications. So by the time you leave Wellesley, I hope that you will not only have some new tools and connections, but even more importantly, new confidence and determination. Because this, as you know so well, is only the beginning. The real work lies ahead for each of you back home. I also hope that the Women in Public Service Project will continue going and growing as well. The summer institute will rotate to each of the founding Seven Sisters colleges in the coming years. And these schools have created a foundation that will sustain and coordinate this effort for the future. And that's not all. Later this summer, the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh will host another conference for women from across South Asia. The State Department will also sponsor two summer institutes for women student leaders at Simmons College and St. Mary's in Indiana. Then in the fall, Smith College, in collaboration with the State Department and the French Government, will organize a gathering focused on women's leadership in public health around the world. And early next year, three women's colleges on the West Coast - Scripps, Mount Saint Mary's, and Mills - will welcome young women leaders from Latin America. So there's a lot to do and it all depends on you. And let me leave you with one last memory. One of my classmates at Wellesley, and still a friend of mine today, was the granddaughter of one of America's greatest diplomats, the former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Four years later, right before graduation, I was introduced to him. And I was pretty nervous about making a speech the next morning. But Secretary Acheson shook my hand and said, """"I'm looking forward to hearing what you say,"""" and that made me even more nervous. (Laughter.) Well, today, I'm saying to each of you I am looking forward to hearing what you have to say, and to seeing what you will accomplish and to admiring the progress that you will achieve. And I want you also to know that the United States will stand with you as your partner and as your supporter as you do what is necessary to secure democracy and the universal human rights that every human being is entitled to. So I thank you. I thank you for coming to be part of this, our first event. I thank Wellesley for hosting and for nurturing generations of young women like Madeleine Albright and myself. And I am thrilled that there is such an outpouring of support from around the academic world not only here in the United States, but globally, to give you what you need to help you make the decisions that are right for you as you continue your own journey of leadership and service. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) MS. BOTTOMLY: Thank you, Secretary Clinton, and thank you for agreeing to take some questions. We'll now open this up to questions from the audience. There are microphones that will be located in each of the aisles, and we will also have a microphone so those of you in the balcony can participate in this. Although I can't see you very well, I'll try to see your hand. So if you'd like to ask a question - and I know many of you who are Wellesley women, you probably will want to ask questions - (laughter) - so please raise your hand and a microphone will be brought to you. We have one right here. QUESTION: Thank you very much for the brilliant and very inspiring talk. My name is Jackcilia Ebere, the state minister for labor in Western Equatoria State, South Sudan. I have a question: As you know, we are yet the newest country in the world. We have gotten the independence after a long struggle, and that independence is even shaky because since the signing of the peace agreement in 2005, some of the terms of the agreement remain hanging and were not implemented until you have gotten independence such as the border issues and sharing of resources. Currently, there is an issue about the border and the oil now, which is almost escalating into war. So I'm asking: How can the United States help us, South Sudan, to intervene so that the hanging issues are resolved peacefully without the two countries, North and South, returning again to war? Because women and children are the victims of this war. Thank you. SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Well, your question points out one of the most serious dangers for widespread conflict that we face in the world today. Some of you may know that there was a very long conflict between the north and the south of Sudan. There was a peace treaty entered into in 2005. The United States played a major role, along with Norway and the United Kingdom, in helping to negotiate that peace treaty. And it provided for the people of the South to have a referendum to determine whether they wanted to stay in Sudan or break away and form their own state. And the people in the South voted for a new state. That new state came into being last summer. And there was a roadmap about what needed to be done in order to implement all of the requirements of the peace agreement. Sadly, there has not been the kind of cooperation that was called for. There is currently an ongoing mediation process that is sponsored by the African Union in Addis Ababa. The United States is very active in this. The lead mediator is the former president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. And it comes down to two very difficult issues, which the questioner referenced: One, exactly what are the borders? They were determined to a great extent but not completely by the time South Sudan became an independent state. And how will the oil be - the oil profits be distributed? Because most of the oil is in South Sudan but the pipelines and the infrastructure are in Sudan. And this is a perfect example of where both sides need to make decisions that will give them a positive outcome, although it most likely will not be all that they want. How do they compromise in a way that keeps the peace, sets borders, and divides oil revenues? And unfortunately, because of the ongoing disagreements and actions taken by both sides to try to assert themselves, there has been a return to violence disproportionately by the government in Khartoum because they are using modern military equipment - fighter planes and the like - against people living in the southern areas right across the border from the new South Sudan. And we are working very hard to try to find a peaceful way to bring this to a conclusion because in the absence of a peaceful resolution, we are very worried that war will break out again, and the principal victims of war in the world today everywhere are women and children. Fifty, 100 years ago, going back through history, when wars were fought, they were usually fought between armies or militias or guerrilla units but they were primarily fought soldier versus soldier. Now that has changed, and the victims are often women and children who are caught up in whatever the conflict is. And it is a deeply distressing situation for me because I think both Sudan and South Sudan should be paying attention to the needs of their people, and the only way to do that is to have peace, and to have the revenues from oil justly divided, and to have the borders justly determined, so that South Sudan can build their institutions and Sudan can continue to look for better ways to serve people and end conflicts that are still ongoing in places like Darfur. So we're hoping for a peaceful outcome, and we're working with the African Union to achieve that. But it is truly up to the leaders to make some hard decisions and even some compromises to avoid war. And that's what we're trying to convince them to do. (Applause.) MS. BOTTOMLY: Right down here in front, in the green scarf, with the microphone. Oh, I'm sorry. Go right ahead. You were next. QUESTION: Good morning. Thank you so much for coming, and thank you for your continued support of women in leadership. My name is Jayna Gane. I'm a rising a senior here at Wellesley, and I am unofficially representing Jamaica. (Laughter.) I have a - my question is pertaining to countries like Jamaica, mostly in the Caribbean, where we're not currently under civil war or wars between other nations or there isn't an overt presence of oppression based on religion. I feel that a lot of times, people tend to forget us as the Caribbean region and Jamaica in particular because things seem to be going well. And so I was wondering what measures or what projects the Women in Public Service Institute plans on undertaking to help women in Jamaica and women in other nations in the Caribbean to basically move forward in our democracy because it is there but it is not present in a way that is working very well, so to speak. And so if you could speak a little bit about that. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I'm very happy you raised that because it is true that countries where there's not obvious conflict and terrible things happening, like we were just talking about in South Sudan and the border areas of Sudan, may not get the attention of the international community that they deserve to have. Jamaica, as you know, has had a long history of violence, drug trafficking, gangs, poverty, and so there is work to be done in Jamaica. And Jamaica just elected a woman prime minister, and I called her after her election and offered as much technical assistance and support as we could. And I sent a team from our government down there to meet with her because we now know some things that work in order to reverse poverty. We have seen in Brazil and Mexico, for example, that using what are called conditional cash transfers to families where the money has to be spent on improving the health of the children, the education of the children, can begin to reverse generational poverty. We know that concentrating on education as a pathway to opportunity for poor children remains a very important commitment. How do you do that when you don't have enough teachers, you don't have enough curriculum, you don't have the resources? What can we learn about what has worked in other countries that we can bring to a country like Jamaica? So I am not at all overlooking the need for the United States and the international community to work together in countries that are not necessarily in the headlines in order to provide as much support as we possibly can. And that's particularly true in our own neighborhood. In this hemisphere, we've seen great commitment to democracies. Some of the young women who are here from countries that have been under military rule and autocratic rule should take heart from what has happened in Latin America in the last 20 years, where there has been movement from military dictatorships to very vibrant democracies, where women have been elected presidents of countries like Chile and Brazil and even Costa Rica and a prime minister in Jamaica, because democracy has taken hold against great odds, a lot of poverty, a lot of discrimination against women and minorities. So there is a real pathway for progress, and I want to make sure that continues in our own hemisphere and that it can be an example for countries elsewhere. (Applause.) This young woman right there. QUESTION: Thank you, and again, it's such a pleasure for me to be here. I'm Naheed Farid and I'm the youngest member of Afghanistan parliament. The question that I have is related to United States presence in Afghanistan. You have the longest war with terrorism in Afghanistan. It lasts for 10 years and is a continuance in 2014. And finally you signed an Strategic Partnership with Afghanistan. Some people in Afghanistan think that United States is going to escape from my country because of this trouble and problem and treating from Taliban. In another side, we don't have infrastructure, we have fraud election in Afghanistan, we have open borders, and we don't have a good situation of economy. And you know that democracy is a new thing in my country, and people - human - don't realize human rights, the values of the human rights and democracy. Don't you think that after withdrawal of United States and international troops from Afghanistan after 2014 there will be a disaster of democracy in the region, especially in Afghanistan? Thank you. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first let me congratulate you on serving in your parliament, and I hope you don't mind that I mentioned you in my remarks, because I spent a lot of time in Afghanistan and I know how challenging the environment is for all the reasons that you suggested. Let me just make a few points. One, the United States signed the Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan as a strong signal of our continuing commitment and support. Secondly, President Obama and I and others have said consistently that we are drawing out combat troops, but we will negotiate with the Government of Afghanistan for a continuing military presence that will help train and assist and support the Afghan National Security Forces. The primary responsibility for the security of Afghanistan, as with any country, has to be the security forces, the military and the police, in that country. But we're well aware that there will still be a role for the international community, including the United States, to play in making sure that the forces are able to defend Afghanistan. We have said we do not want - and I want to underscore this - we do not want any bases in Afghanistan, but we will continue, with the approval and the request of the Afghan Government, to operate certain functions inside Afghanistan, to support you when we know that you will continue to face very concerted attacks from the Taliban and their allies to try to undo the progress that has been made. You are a perfect example of that progress. When the Taliban was overthrown in Afghanistan, there was not one legal school for one girl anywhere in the country. I mean, that's astonishing. I mean, you think about how could a country not want even to educate their girls, but that was the case with the Taliban. There were grave difficulties facing women and girls to get healthcare, and women were not permitted to work. So you had widows, you had terrible family circumstances where women were - by definition - considered unsuitable, unacceptable in society, and they couldn't do anything to help support their families or their children or even get healthcare for themselves and their children. So when people say, """"Well, what have we gotten done in Afghanistan over the last 10 years?"""" I think it's only fair to look at the changes that have happened in terms of the millions of children - at least 40 percent of whom are now girls - in school; the thousands of young women going to university, like yourself; the hospitals, the clinics, the healthcare outreach. I mean much to everyone's amazement, a country that had the worst rate of maternal mortality associated with childbirth - pregnancy, labor, childbirth - has made great improvements that have been applauded by the international public health community. There is still a lot of work to be done, but how could one expect there would not be? I am always amazed at how quick people are to make judgments about new democracies and not look back on our own history and the difficulties we had. Our constitution did not include African slaves or women or men who didn't own property. We had to fight a civil war, a terrible, bloody civil war. We had to amend our constitution. We had to change our laws, and equally importantly, we had to change our attitude. So I get somewhat - (applause) - I get somewhat frustrated when I see commentators or politicians or others say: Well, what's Egypt going to do? What's Afghanistan going to do? How's Libya ever going to hold elections? Well, for goodness sakes, we're just getting started. (Laughter.) And that's why all of you are here, because we want you to be some of the leaders who help answer those questions going forward. So I can assure you that we are prepared - so long as the government and the people of Afghanistan wish to have our help - not only to help on security, but also to continue to help on development. I will be going to Tokyo in July for an international conference to determine what we can do to help on continuing to improve the government functioning, to improve the economic prospects, as well as services like health and education. And it's important to take stock of what has been accomplished and then to have a vision about where your country and other countries represented here can go. So I am very committed to making sure that we stand with you and support you on your journey. (Applause.) QUESTION: Good afternoon, Hillary. It's an honor to be here. I'm also unofficially representing class of '88, but also Pakistan. I want to thank you for, a few years ago, making the last minute detour to Pakistan when you were on your trip to India. It meant a lot to us here in America. But my question - I mean, there's so much work to be done in Pakistan and women are, as you know, heavily involved in public service. And my question actually is about women in public service in America. And there's so much work to be done here too. And I was wondering if this project will extend into that area that is needed here in America as well with women's participation and all the wealth or resources, as you said we have, and what a shame not to use them here at home. And - that's all. Thank you. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, thank you. I think that this particular program is filling what we see as a gap. And it's one that we feel strongly can be addressed through the kind of intensive outreach that we're doing - starting today - not only at Wellesley, but as I said, elsewhere. And I think that, with respect to public service and women in our own country, clearly we have a lot of activity and energy going into that arena. We have women running for and holding office. We have women in many high-level corporate positions. We have many women who lead academic institutions like Wellesley and others. So we have a lot of signs of progress and change, certainly from the time that I was here as a student. But I would be the first to say we have work to do as well. I have talked about how difficult it is for women running for office in our political system because we have a particularly difficult set of obstacles to run through. You have to raise your own money, which in many parliamentary systems is not the case. You have to contend with the continuing double standard that exist in my country - as it does, apparently, everywhere still - where women",1,1.0,usecretary state hillary rodham clinton opening

He also noted that after the demise of Prime Minister Meles"" H.E. Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, has held a number of meetings with the leaders of both Sudan and South Sudan to encourage them to reach a final and comprehensive agreement."" He further reassured the Forum that ""the new leadership of the Ethiopian government is equally determined to maintain the legacy of the late Prime Minister and will continue to play a constructive role, based on strict adherence to the principle of neutrality, in order to assist both Sudan and South Sudan in dealing with the few outstanding issues."" Hailing the constructive spirit shown at the recent signing of agreement he called on the international community to encourage the two parties to come in to terms with the remaining post-independence issues. He in particular called the international community to continue assist the two countries ""ratify the cooperation agreement, establish mechanisms for the effective monitoring and implementation of the

37,11647,"From Logali House close to De'Havana Hotel Juba, I walked down through a rugged dark road towards the Ministers' Castles, back to my small crude shelter at the back of J1 State House. While walking, I was thinking about the darkness that enveloped the Ministers' Castles, only to understand that they were in foreign countries enjoying themselves with their children and wives. However, I was horrified by a driver from out of the one of the castles, who deliberately wanted to crush two little boys. He had reversed with great speed and the boys had to run into the corner where they could not help themselves -- behind the wall, shouting in Arabic, ""why do you want to crush us?!"" I stood there open-mouthed. Then, he opened the headlights and sped towards my direction, but I was already alert, so I simply dodged him. This kind of behavior from some people is the reason behind this question: Ordinary South Sudanese, How Valuable Is Your Life? While the rest of the world is talking about the past year events and determining what this will impact on the New Year, I stood aloof and tried to review the life of an ordinary South Sudanese in South Sudan.From Unity State last year, the Militias crossed to Tonj North, Warrap State and killed people including eight policemen and my elderly uncle, and the clan spiritual leader, Aropdit, aged seventy, in his hut. But this was nothing. Their deaths only affected their clan, children and grandchildren. In another part of the world, it would have been different. In Israel or Tunisia and other countries for example, where the life of an ordinary citizen is highly valued, it would have brought uproar from the community and South Sudan in general. The Militias would have been brought to book for killing innocent people. But no! Some of the Militias who committed such heinous crime could be here in Juba, telling stories privately on how they have squashed them and enjoying the festive season with us. Those innocent lives lost were the lives of nobodies.In Warrap State last year, there were reports that ordinary people died like sprayed insects to hunger and some unknown disease in the State. But this report was not independently verified as authorities in Warrap State, claimed it was a political propaganda geared by ""malice"" and ""hatred"" from the enemies of the government of the day. Around Khorfulus, Jonglei State, the ordinary citizens died at the hands of the man, who said he wanted to have his rights and stolen elections restored through armed conflict. Mass graves were sighted. But before Christmas, this man followed to the grave, the masses buried in a mass grave at Khorfulus because of the conflict he had created. Again in Jonglei State as I write, the ordinary citizens are dying in the hands of angry tribe warriors, (first the Murle attack on Lou Nuer; second the Lou Nuer revenge attack on Murle). In Juba, an order was issued belatedly to the police ""to stop conflict'. Even still, the police won't stop this conflict. This order to stop the conflict is not able to address the root causes of this conflict. Is this really cattle or child abduction conflict? Or is the conflict something different, say tribal superiority? Why such massive killing on Murle people of South Sudan and why was it so with Lou Nuer on the first attack? How long did this conflict take that now it has reached such a hopeless state of affairs? Also, the order has really come too late! The order came after a sumptuous celebration of Christmas and a Happy New Year! We are told to be happy and to keep the peace...what peace are we talking about in Jonglei State, amidst the stench of rotten bodies, killed by a conflict that remains a gamble or the old story of cattle rustling? The root cause is acute poverty, which must be addressed in 2012 through an organized plan. By addressing acute poverty in the area, the government would have solved the problem. As we tick towards 2012, the government services must reach the grass root, so that, it becomes easy to talk of peace and coexistence amidst plenty. But that is not the only thing? There are unfortunate individuals here in Juba and in the states that fall victims to some security men, who have got pistols to use whimsically. And I do not know what these security men were being taught in their schools of thought. Were they taught to use pistols on the ordinary citizens or to solve their private disputes instead of the law? Or were they given the pistols only in extreme cases? I don't know. I am just a less privileged citizen of this country - and a likely victim to such state of affairs. In July last year, I wrote ""Open Letter No. 2"", published by the Citizen. In that open letter to the head of state, I have asked His Excellency the President, to look into the issue of some of state security men, especially those who have misplaced their authorities. But still in Juba, some of these state security men wield pistols on the faces of ordinary citizens and nobody is talking about it. People talk about crimes and burning of houses and all that kind of thing without investigating who does it. Why? I think it is because the people concerned brush shoulders with the criminals. Perhaps they pat them on the backs that they are doing well, having not been caught in the act to avoid a flare up from the community concerned. But I think their time is running out. As we tick towards 2016, the ordinary citizens will not allow criminals to joke with their lives just because these crooks' uncles or aunties are leaders who live in fenced and electrified castles. Throughout last year, our government officials (parliament, executive and judiciary), have been here and there doing their own things - enjoying their wealth, visiting families abroad, going to beach resorts abroad, planning their businesses, while the ordinary citizens slaughtered each other and burn their grass thatched houses on flimsy conflicts accelerated by acute poverty. We raised our eyebrows, especially, when sometimes back last year, our Ministers led by the Vice President went to Mombasa to have relaxed recoil (Retreat). In my own opinion, and I hope it is also shared by other ordinary citizens, this sumptuous visit to Mombasa while the infant nation was in agony, reflected the era of King Louis V of France, way back to late seventeen hundreds - a situation of hardship, where bread cost shot sky high but the ""insensitive Antoinette"" the Queen of France at the time, the senseless queen told the ordinary citizens, who have come forward to voice their agony, if bread was expensive, let them buy cakes! This slap in the face from the queen has had something whose result is told throughout the world. And she was living sumptuously while the citizens of France suffered hunger. So, that kind of retreat must not be repeated because it was not much received by the ordinary citizens in South Sudan. The Citizen editorial even posed a question as to why the money wasted on sumptuous lunches and socialization in Mombasa was not being used to buy the drugs and food for the victims of tribal clashes in Jonglei. It is my hope that 2012 will be a great one! My best wishes to the ordinary citizens and a happy and prosperous new year in their small crude dark shelters.",-1,-1.0,logali house close de havana hotel jubawalked throughrugged dark road towards

38,12190,"Kenya and South Sudan have signed an agreement to build an oil pipeline connecting the two countries as Juba looks for an alternative transport route for its top export in the face of a falling out with Khartoum over revenue sharing. A statement from the Prime Minister's office said Energy minister Kiraitu Murungi signed the deal on Wednesday with Sudan's Petroleum and Mines minister Stephen Dhieu allowing for the construction of an oil pipeline and fibre optic connections between the oil fields in South Sudan and the Kenyan port town of Lamu. ""The pipeline will be developed through Kenyan territory and will be built and owned by South Sudan,"" the brief statement released by Mr Raila Odinga's office said. It added that South Sudan president Salva Kiir and Mr Odinga witnessed the accord which comes just weeks before the planned ground breaking ceremony for the Lamu port project next month by President Kibaki. The decision to build a pipeline signals South Sudan's intention to establish separate links after a protracted separation from the north which ended with the establishment of South Sudan as an independent nation last year. Tensions between the two countries have since revolved around what fees Sudan should charge Juba for transporting oil to Port Sudan and more recently, how the revenue from the oil should be shared. On Monday, Mr Kiir accused Sudan of seizing crude oil worth $815 million over the revenue sharing dispute. The two countries have failed to reach an agreement over a transit fee for getting the oil to Port Sudan through a pipeline running north through Sudan. Mr Kiir also accused Sudan of building a tie-in pipeline to divert 120,000 barrels of South Sudan crude oil. Sudan justifies the fee on the grounds that South Sudan has not paid for use of northern export facilities since its independence. Khartoum is demanding $1 billion in fees and $36 per barrel. Besides the alternative pipeline Juba is looking to reduce its dependence on oil revenues which constitute 98 per cent of its income. When completed, the Lamu Project is expected to come with road, rail and pipeline links to Southern Sudan and Ethiopia. Others are an international port in the Indian Ocean town, an airport, and resort cities along the corridor. For Kenya, the move comes just months after the overthrow and subsequent execution of former Libyan strongman Muamar Gaddafi dashed hopes for a similar pipeline extension project to link Eldoret and Kampala. Unlike the Kenya-Uganda pipeline which was to be constructed on a Public-Private Partnership basis, the deal signed yesterday gives Southern Sudan ownership of the pipeline project but the two nations will negotiate transit fees. The Lamu Port-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor targets a modern port at Lamu, an oil refinery, a railway line to Juba in southern Sudan with a branch line to Ethiopia, an oil pipeline linking Lamu with the oil fields of South Sudan, a super highway connecting to Ethiopia and Sudan, an international airport and several resort cities and towns within Kenya. When complete, the Lamu port will be the largest port in Africa. Apart from the port's development, a standard gauge railway line that will start from Lamu to Sudan onwards to the Central Africa Republic, and finally Cameroon, is also in the works. This won't be all for the railway, as within the laid-down plans is a proposal to lay down a line to Uganda, Rwanda, DRC and Congo Brazzaville, with a branch line into Ethiopia. In other words, Kenya is looking at building the largest and most ambitious modern railway investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Three airports are to be built in Lamu, Isiolo and Lokichoggio. These towns are planned as resort cities to cater for a tourism boom. Coupled with these is a fibre-optic cable snaking its way from Lamu to Juba with tentacles carrying bandwidth across the entire corridor, ensuring that the Kenya Internet Exchange Point (KIXP) will attain a new strategic relevance. The proposed Lamu refinery is projected to process some 120,000 barrels of oil each day, much of it from South Sudan. The fuel is expected to feed East Africa's growing demand.",1,0.0,kenya south sudan signed agreement build oil pipeline connecting two countries juba looks alternative transport route top export face

39,12318,"The Fangak Youth Union has issued a press release in which it condemns the recent attack on civilians by the rebels in Fangak County. It reads: Fangak Youth Union would like to condemn, in the strongest term possible, the recent attack by the rebels directed or targeting civilians in Fangak County. On 12th of November, 2011, a civilian passenger boat, which was travelling from Phom El Zeraf, the County headquarters, to Old Fangak, was attacked by armed men believed to be belonging to rebel leader, George Athor. The attack took place between Nyalual and Luoi near Kolanyang, 5 kilometers away from Phom, the County headquarters. The attack occurred at 2 p.m. when the civilian boat unknowingly got into bush which involved heavy fire. The boat as stated above was carrying civilians, mostly children and women going to their destinations via Old Fangak. One (1) person was seriously wounded and died before reaching Phom where he could receive medical treatment. When the boat came under heavy gun fire from the attackers, the helpless civilians had no option but to throw themselves into the river for safety.As a result, children as well as elderly people got drowned in the river since they were unable to swim because of the unceasing heavy gun fire, placing them in state of fear and panic. Four (4) corpses were found Saturday evening floating on the Pow River, the dead toll as of yesterday was 5, and a search team had been dispatched by the commissioner of the County James Maliet. The death toll could rise up since many who have gone missing since the day of the incident are still unaccounted for till now. It was not the first time to attack the civilians in callous manner in Phom and one took place on January 9th this year which left more than 300 people dead and injured many more. The recent attack by the rebels of George Athor came months after his forces had been confronted and 'crashed' militarily by the gallant SPLA forces in response to the callous attack on civilians. Known for their hospitality and sense of forgiveness, the people of Fangak have given shelter and accommodation to thoseinternally displaced people from Korway Payam who are from Dinka Rut community. They have provided them with food, shelter and even security for themselves and their cattle. The people of Fangak will continue doing so on humanitarian grounds and on good will.At this juncture, we would like to strongly condemn this act of targeting our civil population and unleashing fear in them. We wonder why the rebels are terrorizing our civil population. Are they fighting the government or the civilians? We denounce this act by the rebels. We also condemn anybody who has taken up arms against the government but ended up killing civilians in any part of this country. We in the Fangak Youth Union would like to urge the government of the republic of South Sudan and the gallant SPLA forces to provide adequate security to the people of Fangak County in order to avert situation-like- January 9th. The SPLA forces need to beef up their presence in the County so as to protect the civil populations from the hands of the rebels whose objective is to kill and terrorize people. We do not need further bloodshed after gaining our independence on the July 9th, and especially that a lot of blood had been shed already prior to independence. Peace, unity, stability, tranquillity and harmony should now prevail over tribalism and greed for power!Forward in peace ever, backward in war never.",-1,0.0,fangak youth union issuedpress release

42,12382,"Sudan made good on all its war-talk by bombing a refugee camp last week. Nothing unusual there, except for the fact that the camp is in another country - the newly independent South Sudan. Not that Khartoum particularly respects South Sudanese sovereignty. The gigantic Antonovs were a familiar sight during the south's long, bitter struggle for independence from the greater Sudan. Sudan doesn't have much in the way of sophisticated jet fighters, so for its bombing runs it uses lumbering old Russian Antonov cargo plans. These swept low over the targeted rebel base/refugee camp/village, rear doors open, and bombs were simply rolled off the back of the plane. Aim is by eye, and accuracy is not good. Four months after independence, an Antonov made another appearance in the skies above the South Sudan. "" there was a deep and terrifying thud of a nearby explosion,"" wrote BBC journalist James Copnall, who was in the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan's oil-rich Unity State, where the bombs were aimed. ""A large plane glinting silver against the sun was spotted heading to the north...The refugees said the plane had circled, then launched two bombing raids. They said five bombs were dropped, of which four exploded."" South Sudanese government officials claim 12 people died in the attack. Humanitarian organisations say no one was injured. The Sudanese government says the bombing didn't happen at all, although there is enough independent verification to make its denial extremely hard to believe; especially after last week's explicit threats of war from various high-level Sudanese government officials. Yida refugee camp hosts thousands of people who have fled to South Sudan from Sudan, after the conflict intensified between rebels and the government in the disputed states of Abyei, Blue Nile and South Kordofan. This latest cross-border bombing raid is a message to the rebels that Khartoum's reach stretches into the new country of South Sudan and there's not much the south can do about it.

45,13739,"South Sudan's main civil society groups are proposing a delay of 100 days in forming a unity government in order to allow parties to iron out their differences and prevent a possible relapse into war. In a proposal made public Friday, the South Sudan Civil Society Forum said they were disappointed key issues have not been dealt with, ahead of the November 12 deadline, but said rushing into a unity government could be dangerous. ""There can never be a shortcut to meaningful implementation of the R-ARCSS,"" the forum, which brings together youth, gender and religious groups both within South Sudan and in the diaspora, said referring to the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan. ""The parties should jointly provide a unified message to assure citizens of their commitment to the peace agreement. In the days remaining before 12 November, the principals of the parties who are signatories to the peace agreement should hold a retreat in which they develop a realistic 100-day roadmap to the formation of the R-TGoNU."" President Salva Kiir, opposition leader Riek Machar and several other groups known as the South Sudan Opposition Alliance signed an amended agreement last year in September. They initially gave May 12 as deadline to form a unity government but mediators at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) accepted a six-month delay. Ahead of the second deadline, however, Dr Machar's Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition(SPLM-IO) and the SSOA have said the unity government should not be formed unless key issues are addressed. The issued include merger of the armies, vetting and training and deployment of some 3000 soldiers meant to protect VIPs, establishing main camps for soldiers, agreeing on number of regional states as well as drawing boundaries. Much of the delays has been blamed on lack of funds with President Kiir being accused by other parties of refusing to release the money. While Juba insisted the government should be formed, reports emerged this week that some of the soldiers in camps, under an arrangement known as cantonment, were leaving for lack of supplies. SECURITY THREAT The forum said this could raise a new security threat. The forum warned the international community against forcing parties into a unity government without first addressing the issues, saying it could backfire. ""Some regional and international bodies are encouraging them to selectively implement provisions of the R-ARCSS. Such recommendations undermine the entire peace agreement, especially the sequence of agreed implementation schedule. ""These types of political impasses have proved deadly in the past. The political differences among the parties and their failure to accomplish the agreed upon tasks are understandably contributing to increased anxiety and fear among citizens about their safety and the future of the peace agreement."" The Forum said the extension will allow time for parties to first discuss with their constituents, and later meet to deal with each contentious item. ""Guarantors to the R-ARCSS, particularly those in the region, should deliver swift consequences on any party that deliberately attempts to frustrate peace efforts and meaningful implementation of the R-ARCSS."" Last week on October 26, Igad special envoys Ismail Wais, Kalonzo Musyoka, Jamal al-Sheikh, Betty Bigombe, Joram Biswaro met with representatives of the UN, US, China, Japan Norway and UK in Djibouti where they agreed to call for a meeting of parties before November 12. The idea, a dispatch said, was to ""agree on a temporary, viable and realistic arrangement regarding the critical pre-transitional tasks... "" which could require at least $100 million to be implemented.

46,14230,"Juba - South Sudan may have received slightly more than 10 billion dollars in oil revenue from 2005 to January 2012, when oil production shut down, according to both government officials and the World Bank. But development experts have urged the government to begin investing in the country and its people, as basic social services remain scarce. South Sudan shut down its production of oil after a dispute with neighbouring Sudan over transit fees earlier this year. But production is expected to resume in the next few months, after an agreement between the two countries was reached in September. However, Dr. Leben Nelson Moro of Juba University's Faculty of Peace and Development Studies told IPS that the government needed to start setting part of the oil revenues aside to build much-needed infrastructure to kick start this east-central African nation's development. ""The oil money must be used in a manner that will be beneficial to the whole country and not the few people who are close to the treasury,"" he says While the government helps fund primary and secondary school education and health services at hospitals in some state capitals, its contribution to these services is minimal. In some hospitals, workers' salaries and medicines are paid for by NGOs, and sometimes the not-for-profit organisations are the sole providers of school textbooks and other stationary supplies in schools here. ""The government needs to adopt new ways of managing the oil revenues so that money goes to development projects that benefit the whole country,"" Moro stressed. ""We know that while many parts of the country are food insecure, there are places like Yei (Yei County in Central Equatoria State) and Western Equatoria state that produce plenty of food. You need to build roads to where the food is produced,"" he said. South Sudan has only 110 kilometres of tarmac roads in the capital, Juba, with only one tarmac road linking the city to the Ugandan border. In addition, many areas here are only accessible by air. Moro said that the government also needed to prioritise education and also provide basic services like healthcare. ""We have many young people who need skills. The government should ensure young people receive skills training to enable them to get jobs. ""In order for our people to work hard and develop the country, they must first be in good health. But for them to be healthy there must be good healthcare services in the country,"" said Moro. The majority of South Sudan's nearly nine million people have no access to any form of healthcare. According to the Ministry of Health, South Sudan currently has 120 medical doctors, slightly over 100 registered nurses and less than 150 qualified midwives. In some rural areas patients have to walk for two or more days to reach the nearest healthcare centre. South Sudan has some of the worst health indicators globally. According to the United Nations Population Fund, this country's maternal mortality rate is the worst in the world with 2,054 deaths for every 100,000 live births, largely because about 90 percent of women give birth away from formal medical facilities. Hospitals here lack drugs, equipment and trained workers. In addition, they are overcrowded. Kenyi Spencer, an environmental economist and World Bank consultant on private sector development, told IPS that given that oil is a non-renewable resource, the money earned from it should be used to develop other sectors, like agricultural production. ""Agriculture will be the real driver of South Sudan's economy in future, but the government has to take measures to develop it,"" Spencer said. He urged the government to prioritise education, arguing that the country's high illiteracy rate was hindering development efforts. In 2011 the government announced that South Sudan's illiteracy rate was 73 percent. This country became Africa's newest nation in July 2011. But decades of war with Sudan have meant that only a handful of the population were able to attend school. ""What is needed here is really a technical, rather than a theoretical, education. For this country to develop it needs plumbers, electricians, mechanics, carpenters and so forth. That is where the money should be invested,"" Spencer said. High among expectations is that as oil begins to flow again, the government will end the current austerity measures introduced in February. The measures, which included a cut in civil servants' salaries, were implemented soon after the shut-down in oil production, which accounted for 98 percent of the country's total GDP. Many have not been happy with the forced cutbacks in this landlocked nation. On Sep. 7, in Rumbek Central County in the Lakes state, a group of 30 policemen attacked and shot the county's Police Inspector Lieutenant Colonel Mangar Kajeny Kamich in the arm. They were reportedly unhappy about pay cuts. The previous day, wildlife officers in the same state beat up their immediate superior after a reduction in their pay was announced, according to a report by the local Sudan Tribune newspaper. Moro said that the government needed to increase civil servants' salaries once the country began producing oil. ""Many civil servants were affected by these measures. In the universities, some of the staff lost almost 75 percent of their income. Once oil begins to flow, it is inevitable that the government will have to do something about salaries,"" he said. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir promised in November that once oil production began, resources would be devoted to service delivery. ""Our physical and food security are top on the list of priority services we want to provide to our people. We will use the oil money to improve agriculture by providing farmers with seeds, tools and improved access to markets,"" he said.",-1,-1.0,juba south sudan may received slightly 10 billion dollars

The President made the appeal while meeting the visiting UK minister for Armed Forces, Col Mark Lancaster who called on him at his Kisozi farm in Gomba District. According to a statement released by State House yesterday, Mr Museveni and the British delegation discussed regional political developments particularly in Somalia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""Mr Museveni told his guests that imposing sanctions on South Sudan will not help in finding a solution to that country's challenges adding that observation of ceasefire by the warring groups, security reform and working to have elections, among others, will help the country move towards peace,"" the statement reads. In February, the UK government put its weight to European Union sanctions against three former and current officials in South Sudan responsible for serious human rights violations and obstructions of the political process. Paul Malong, Malek Reuben Riak and Michael Makuei Leuth have be subject to sanctions by all EU member states, effective February. At the time, UK's minister for Africa, Ms Harriett Baldwin said; ""It is more vital than ever that those undermining the peace process recognise the price of their actions. The UK has played a leading role in pushing for these sanctions at an EU level and it is right that we are taking tough action against those who continue to act against the interests of the South Sudanese people."" She also said that the UK government was committed to supporting the peace process and urged the South Sudanese leaders to agree a political solution. During the Kisozi farm meeting, the British Minister who did not discuss the said sanctions, said that his government is appreciative of the support that Uganda is rendering in Somalia with a view to achieving a stable political situation in that country, the statement added. The President and Mr Lancaster also discussed how Uganda and the UK can strengthen their long standing relations in areas of free trade, market and employment opportunities UTILITY Currently, the UK Parliament is handling the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018. This aimed at making provision enabling sanctions to be imposed where appropriate for the purposes of compliance with United Nations obligations or other international obligations or for the purposes

""Leaders have to come to their senses to their mind and they should somehow leave so they give power to new young leadership that can continue to the next step,"" he added. Hailemariam , however, said everybody has to help to end the war in South Sudan including the African Union and United Nations, ""The UN should take aggressive action,"" he emphasized.

50,15257,"The evolution of South Sudan as an entity that constitutes a nation state, just like any of the African countries, has its roots in colonization of Africa during European Scramble for Africa in late 19th century. Contrary to the myth of a United Sudan, a disastrous experiment, which actually failed to survive, South Sudan evolution into a nation state contrast that of the Northern Sudan. Perhaps the only thing the South and North Sudan has in common throughout the history is that the two are explicably linked by the Nile River. Otherwise, the South and North of Sudan are regions of different entities. When the British and Egyptian jointly colonized Sudan, with all the good judgment, they immediately determined that the South and North of Sudan must be administered separately, given the fact that in all practical sense, the two regions are different from one another. The Anglo-Egyptian rulers instituted a colony of South Sudan to be governed under a Closed Districts Ordinance, where Northern Sudanese access into Southern Sudan is strictly restricted. Lines were clearly drawn on the sand and even on the mud to mark the boundaries and the distinctions. The good British administrators at the time had good reasons for drawing those boundaries as they have been proven with time to be like prophets. Among those British officials, was a prominent administrator in Sudan, K.D.D. Henderson who warned his government that those Northerners are either ""raiders or traders"" in South Sudan. He went on to explain the horrific role of the Northern Sudanese and he said, ""when not slave raiding they were poaching elephants or hunting giraffe or lifting cattle. When they condescended to do a little trading, they usually swindled the unsophisticated Nilote or paid him with counterfeit coins. As for the professional trader, the Jellaba, he in baronial eyes was an equally undesirable immigrant, battering on the villages, selling rubbishy goods at a vast profit, and introducing venereal disease."" Even though slowly maturing during the colonialism, South Sudan was recognizable as a nation state, growing on its own pace to independently join as one of the nations of the world. By 1940s, as the notion of self determination was gaining momentum throughout the British colonies, the fact of South Sudan evolving as a distinct entity was becoming very apparent. There was serious considerations and debates as to whether South Sudan would be cast together with East African countries, the North Sudan, partially with each, or it would be allowed to exist on its own accord. A British inspector general from the Lado Enclave (the present day, Equatoria region) put it bluntly in a policy release by outlining that ""little can be done for the Negro provinces whilst they are starved so as to turn over all available funds to the Arab provinces, and whilst they are subject to the laws and regulations made for the benefit of the latter...So the Negro provinces should be put in a class by themselves, under a vice-governor...and allow to work their own salvation..."" This view was actually shared by many British Civil Servants who were working in South Sudan. After the Unification of the South and North of Sudan in a policy known as Sudanization, which was put in full motion by early 1950s, one of such British Civil Servant wrote in disgust that ""without protection the Southerners will not be able to develop along indigenous lines, will be overwhelmed and swamped by the North and deteriorate into servile community hewing wood and drawing water. To pretend that there are not fundamental differences between them is like covering up a crack in the tree trunk with moss. Such process, like any obscuring of the truth, is unsound."" Such accurate assertion was later proven to be correct by Commission of Enquiry, which investigated the 1955, Torit Mutiny, when the Southerners revolted against the would-be independent Sudan. In its report, the Commission wrote in part, ""since the Southern Sudanese benefited very little from Sudanization they found little or no difference between conditions now and conditions previously; and independence for them was regarded as merely change of masters. We feel that the Southern Sudanese by finding themselves holding secondary positions in the Government of their country have a genuine grievance."" Unfortunately, that ""genuine grievance"" of South Sudan, though obvious, has not been acknowledged soon enough. It has taken decades of bloody wars, millions of precious lives lost, untold destructions, and displacement of millions. The resilience of South Sudanese people and their relentless struggle for freedom and justice has finally paid off. Let the entire world welcome the new country of South Sudan and its people with a huge hug, for all along the people of South Sudan have been journeying the long walk for freedom.

51,15313,"Khartoum - In recent days, Khartoum repeatedly accused Juba of supporting rebel forces of the Sudan Revolutionary Front (an alliance of the main Sudanese rebel movements). A spokesman of the Darfuri Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) strongly denied the presence of rebel fighters in South Sudan. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yousef El Kordofan, told reporters of the Sudanese Media Center in Khartoum last Sunday that the Sudanese government ""has documented information"" that proves Juba's backing of the armed movements, and called on South Sudan to commit itself to agreements made in the past. In the 2012 Sudanese-South Sudanese Cooperation Agreement, the countries agreed to stop supporting or harbouring rebel groups, and to establish a buffer zone at the border, as well as a ""joint monitoring team to prevent rebel infiltration"". JEM: Mohamed Atta, Director-General of the National intelligence and Security Service (NISS), last week threatened to pursue the insurgents inside South Sudanese territory. In his speech on the occasion of a parade of Rapid Support Forces (a militia force commanded by the NISS) on Wednesday, Atta again warned Juba against the supporting and funding of Sudanese rebels. He pointed in particular to the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). The NISS director asserted that JEM forces are still present in Northern Bahr El Ghazal, and stressed that Khartoum considers any hostile action by the JEM, or any other rebel group, from inside South Sudan's territory an ""act of aggression"" by Juba. He also blamed the UN Mission in South Sudan (Unmiss) that denied the presence of Sudanese rebel forces in South Sudanese territory. Arguments: JEM spokesman, Jibril Adam Bilal, however, strongly denied the presence of any rebel forces, affiliated with the Sudan Revolutionary Front, in South Sudan. ""Khartoum is searching for an excuse to raid South Sudan, in order to regain control of its northern oil-rich parts,"" he told Radio Dabanga today (Thursday). ""After the Sudanese government provided military and logistical support to the South Sudanese rebels and militia groups, it now starts to collect excuses and arguments to raid and occupy the South Sudanese oil regions, such as the arguments you are hearing from Mohamed Atta.""",-1,0.0,khartoum recent days khartoum repeatedly accused juba supporting rebel forces sudan revolutionary front

52,15848,"Mayiandit - Two traders from Sudan's western region of Darfur, who were attacked last week in South Sudan's Unity State, have claimed that the assailants were dressed in military uniforms. The two traders were attacked by unknown gunmen on Friday, 6 January, in Rubkuay payam [district], Mayiandit county, in Unity state. The attack took place at 2 am local time. Sudan Tribune visited Rubkuay on Thursday and found that one of the assaulted traders had been shot in both legs and rushed to Leer Hospital then transferred to the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hospital at Langkien. Moses Mohamed Jerenabi told Sudan Tribune he lost 5,000 SSP (US$1,900) in the attack perpetrated by assailants ""dressed in SPLA [Sudan People's Liberation Army] uniforms and claiming to be part of SPLA"". Jerenabi described being held at gunpoint and bound during the robbery. He called out and was attended by Abdalarahman Yousif Omer, who was shot. He called upon the Mayiandit community to avoid the label, ""Arab"" which associates him and others, who are ""proud to be South Sudanese"", with North Sudan. Jerenabi asked that the county authorities to collaborate with the traders to improve the security situation. Bilal Koang Malual, executive director of Mayiandit county, said that security personnel will investigate the incident and more police will be deployed to the market where it took place. He called upon the traders to continue normal trading. Anonymous local residents corroborated the traders allegation that the thieves were dressed in SPLA uniforms. However, this was the first such incident noted by those interviewed. Malual said the SPLA soldiers and their barracks have been searched for the missing money, but no evidence has been found. Cases of indiscipline are rife within members of the SPLA which fought for two decades as a rebel group before South Sudan became an independent state in July last year.",-1,0.0,mayiandit two traders

53,16073,"Addis Ababa - South Sudanese leader of the rebel SPLM-In-Opposition, Riek Machar, has appointed top military generals to reorganize, command and control their fighters against president Salva Kiir's government. South Sudan's rebel leader Riek Machar attends the 28th extraordinary summit of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) for heads of state and government in Addis Ababa on 6 November 2014 (Photo: Reuters/Tiksa Negeri) In the order released on Thursday, Machar has appointed Major General Simon Gatwech Dual as Chief of General Staff for the rebel forces. ""Pursuant to December 6-12, 2014 Pagak conference resolutions, I, Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon, Chairman and Commander-in-Chief, SPLM/SPLA, hereby appoint Major General Simon Gatwech Dual as Chief of General Staff,"" reads the order seen by Sudan Tribune, dated 21 December 2014. General Gatwech who attended Juba University previously served as deputy director in charge of production department at the army headquarters of Bilpam in the capital, Juba. He later on fell out with president Kiir in 2012, and was arrested and detained for a year. He was released in 2013 without charges. Before his new assignment he was the opposition's military governor for Jonglei state, in which his forces control much of the South Sudan's largest state. Other top commanders appointed include Major General Peter Gatdet Yaka as deputy chief of general staff for military operations, Major General Gathoth Gatkuoth Hothnyang, deputy chief of general staff for logistics and Major General Gabriel Gatwech Chan, (aka Gabriel Tanginye), as Inspector-General for SPLA. Also some more commanders are yet to be appointed as deputies to take charge for administration, training and moral and orientation. APPOINTED GOVERNORS The rebel leader also appointed governors for some of the 21 newly created federal states for South Sudan. These include Major General Chayuot Manyang Wuor, governor of Adar (North East Upper Nile) state, Major General Duop Lam, governer of Phou state, Major General Mabor Marier Makol, governor of Rumbek state, Brig General Ruai Kuol Jal, governor of Lich state, Duer Chuol Kur for Sobat state, Tingo Peter Rogbigo Limgbo, governor of Wau state and Marko Lokidor Lochipio, governor of Kapoeta state. NEW COUNTIES Machar restructured the newly created Sobat state, re-establishing its 8 counties to include Nasir, Kewer, Thorow, Wanding, Malou, Ulang, Baliet and Akoka. He appointed Colonel Kang Guoch Deng, as commissioner of the newly created Malou county, Luke Mok Kueth for Nasir county, Colonel Nhial Puoch Jak for Kewer county, John Wiyual Kuach Bithou as commissioner of Thorow county and Isaac Tor for Wanding county. Machar's spokesperson, James Gatdet Dak, told Sudan Tribune that consultations were ongoing for appointments of the other ""14 governors and creation of additional counties in the other 20 states as necessary as well as appointment of more commissioners."" He defended the creation of 21 federal states and more counties, saying it was in line of the principle of taking towns closer to the people for better delivery of services and collective decision-making. Dak further added that the newly appointed officials will organise and establish their respective administrations in the liberated areas, saying their appointments was an important step. ""The appointments of state governors and commissioners is an important step in order to mobilise the people in support of our cause even in government-controlled areas and provide security for the populations in areas under our control,"" he said. ""They will also effectively coordinate humanitarian interventions in alleviating the suffering of the affected populations in the country,"" stressed the rebel spokesperson. Observers say the recent political and military measures taken by the two warring factions of the SPLM, show that with the stalemate of the IGAD brokered peace talks the both sides are preparing for a long war ahead.",0,0.0,addis ababa south sudanese leader rebel splm opposition riek machar appointed top military generals reorganize command control fighters president salva kiirgovernment south

55,16760,"South Sudan's famous son Panchol Deng Ajang Luk concluded his first ever tour of USA, with a riveting performance on the night of Saturday, September 30th, 2017, in Omaha, Nebraska. The event was organized by the leadership of Duk Community USA. Ajang came to America on July 17 for an 11-week concert tour which took him to 8 cities, before rounding out the visit with a welcoming on September 30th. The music legend had concerts in Salt Lake City, UT; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; Grand Rapids, MI; Louisville, KY; Guymon, OK; and Boston, MA. It was therefore logical that the final week was reserved for him to attend the event hosted by Duk Community, in his capacity as a native son, according to John Malith Akuei, the person behind the arrangement that brought the legendary singer to the U.S. ""Our utmost gratitude goes to Rebecca Achol Kuany, and John Malith Akuei for setting aside September 30th for Duk community fundraising and farewell party for Panchol Deng Ajang,"" said David H.Thon, the President of Duk Community USA, in a Facebook post shared after the event with community and supporters. A Well-Organized Event All manner of indications pointed to the fact that the event was a success, thanks to the hard work by members of Duk Community living in Omaha, the host city. The event, part fundraiser and part farewell for the legendary singer, was the first of its kind by the newly elected leadership of Duk Community USA, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to serve the people of Duk in their home Counties in Jonglei, South Sudan. ""We had so much fun and raised a good amount of money (updates coming soon) to support our people in South Sudan,"" said Duk Community president, David Hoth Thon in the same congratulatory statement to community and supporters, which he posted to his Facebook page. This resoundingly remarkable success of the community event and fundraiser, led by Mr. David Thon and his Vice President Mawut Paul Awel, as well as the overall leadership of Duk Community in the U.S., spoke to the organizing spirit and teamwork. Individual members of the Duk Community went above and beyond to help the leadership full off this fundraising drive. And it was not lost on the leadership that those same individuals deserved much appreciation for their hard work and selfless contributions. ""I want to recognize and wholeheartedly appreciate my sister Agot Awuou Leek for mobilizing financial support from her friends and colleagues in Louisville Kentucky to support Duk community. Her financial support to Duk community amounts to $ 2,000! She has uniquely exemplified the important role our sisters can play in supporting our community,"" Thon wrote. A banquet style kind of a setting, with chairs and tables rented by the host committee, everyone who came to the event enjoyed the festive atmosphere at this South Omaha YMCA Program Center until the wee hours of Sunday morning. The organization has been working actively to make a difference in the lives of their people by mobilizing resources with the aim of repopulating most deserted areas back home, according to its president David Thon, hence the reason for the fundraiser. It was this worthy cause which brought together members of Duk Community along with their friends and supporters from other South Sudanese communities for a night of fun, cultural entertainment, and monetary pledges; and, to bid Panchol farewell. Leaders of other South Sudanese Diaspora community organizations came to lend Duk Community their financial support. Thon extended the same appreciation to leaders of neighboring communities. ""Thank you Beny Abraham Bul Thuc for your great support to Duk community. You have exemplified what it means to ""work together"" for the common good of our people. Your presence meant so much and now I know I can always count on your support. We are deeply grateful and indebted to people of Twi community for their generous financial support,"" he wrote in reference to president of Twi Community, Mr. Bul Thuc Dut. ""Our many thanks go to Makech Kuol Mabil for representing Bor community and for great cultural demonstration. Thank you Bor community for your presence and financial support,"" he added, before rounding it out with, ""We greatly appreciate Padang and Bahr el ghazel people for their presence and financial support. We need each other in order to effect much needed change in South Sudan."" The Ultimate Concert Experience Ajang's visit to the U.S. was made possible through efforts by John Malith Akuei and his wife Rebecca Achol Kuany de Mabior, who are residents of Kansas City, MO. The two were given a chance during welcoming of the legendary artist at the Duk Community event. Akuei talked about their concert journeys and also took the time to thank and recognize 'Team Panchol'--the individuals who helped them with organizing concerts in various cities. ""We greatly appreciate your collaboration and support. We are also thankful to Rebecca Achol and John Malith for supporting and promoting our great music legend and artist, Panchol Deng Ajang,"" wrote David Thon. ""Your commitment and determination made it possible for Panchol Deng Ajang to visit United States after many failed attempts."" Mr. Akuei, in particular, went over some of the major things they had managed to accomplish in the very short dutration that Panchol Deng Ajang was in the U.S., such as making sure the legendary singer was connected with some of music's outlets: for example, they 'took him to a professional studio for portraits; made sure his songs were digitally re-mastered; designed CD covers bearing South Sudan flag; got a website; signed up on iTunes, and PMI,' all with the objective of enhancing and promoting the legendary artist as well as a culture of professionalism in the emerging South Sudan's music industry. Akuei believes in advancing and promoting South Sudanese musicians. He said it was important as it could also serve as ""a tribute to other music legends such as Nyankol Mathiang and Amos Ajak,"" two famous music icons who have since passed. Taking to the podium at exactly 11: 40 pm, Mr. Ajang, in a characteristic humility he is always know for, acknowledged the presence of elders and wished they had spoken first. He narrated the challenges faced over the years while trying to facilitate the visit. The legendary artist had few words of advice for those in the Diaspora, urging them to prioritize events in order not to be discouraged by too many activities and to always put God first in everything, because according to him, he has always ""put God first in all in everything he does--in all his journeys."" He also expressed gratitude for having met with fans, friends and relatives. ""Thank you to all who attended my concerts,"" said the legendary singer, before taking the stage to perform a couple of his songs, surrounded by adoring fans dancing to the sounds and lyrics of his songs. In a reverential nod to Dinka cultural expression, the legendary artist was also joined on stage by a young cultural advocate named Makech Kuol. Adorning traditional beads, a head gear, and a hand bell, Kuol stood next to artist Panchol Deng Ajang, singing a song he composed as an ode to leaders of communities. A Warm Send-Off Prominent elders of Duk Community along with invited guests also spoke; praising the legendary artist for his great contributions. Afterwards, President David H. Thon also acknowledged with gratitude the extraordinary presence of community elders. In attendance were the honorable Mathiang Malual Mabuur, and his wife, national Member of Parliament, Anne Nyathon Lino Wuor Abyei; uncle Kosia Kuanydit de Mabior and his wife Akeerdit; and uncle Mathiang Lem, who came to give Panchol a warm send-off and to encourage all members of the Diaspora community and their leadership. ""We are grateful to our national MP Anne Lino Wuor Abyei and Honorable Mathiang Malual Mabur for participating in our community event. Their presence was symbolic and meant so much to us,"" he wrote in the Facebook post. ""We are also grateful to Baba Kothia Kuanydit and Mama Akerdit for gracing our community event with their presence. We wish them good health and more years,"" he added. Uncle Kosia Kuanydit de Mabior, from Awulian, who has been teaching the word of God since 1967, said when he got invitation from the leader of Duk Community to attend the event, he did not hesitate. ""I wanted to come and bid Panchol farewell,"" he said. Of course, the two met earlier in Salt Lake City, during the first concert. Uncle Kuanydit praised the legendary artist for his musical genius and for his patriotism. Most everybody who is familiar with Panchol's music knows the message of his songs is positivity--his songs are meaningful and invaluable to society and country. It is such musical genius which has allowed Panchol Deng Ajang to fuse aspects of traditional and modern life, our culture and liberation era and used those to compose some of the most indelible songs. ""Panchol loves the homeland,"" said uncle Kuanydit. The esteemed elder and spiritual teacher also urged South Sudanese to be clear-eyed and to remain united. ""If we can come together they way we have tonight, we need to ask ourselves what it's that brings another divisions,"" he wondered. Honorable Mathiang Malual Mabuur also praised singer Panchol Deng Ajang, calling him a ""teacher,"" a reference to the way his songs touch people. ""His songs are uplifting and empowering."" ""He has a good heart,"" added honorable Mabuur. Of course friends, family, and fans alike always attest to the fact that Ajang is someone who is humble, caring and compassionate. Honorable Mabuur, a respected elder, also had encouraging words for the leadership of Duk Community USA. ""You have worked hard,"" he assured them. Immediately following him was his wife, Anne Lino Wuor, who thanked the community leadership, and urged all South Sudanese to ""take responsibility."" Mrs. Mabuur said she ""was very impressed"" as she watched leaders of community organizations speak. ""You have reflected unity of South Sudan,"" she told all those gathered in the hall. ""We belong to one country."" She acknowledged the sacrifice and contributions made by those in the Diaspora. ""You are mindful of those back home,"" she said, urging them to keep up. ""It is through you that we are going to fight corruption,"" she added emphatically. ""I'm very happy, and very proud of you,"" she said in her concluding remarks. The Journey Came Full Circle ""Lastly, our special thanks go to Abuna Zachariah Jok Char for playing a vital role in moderating our community event,"" wrote David Thon in recognition of the great work done by the emcee. After the event, the legendary singer Panchol Deng Ajang went back to Kanas City. He left USA on the morning of Thursday, October 5, taking with him 'greetings' to people back home in East Africa. This was a culmination of the much-anticipated visit to the West that was years in the making, first taking him to Canada in 2013, then to Australia in 2014, before rounding it out with 2017 the U.S.

57,17321,"Mogadishu, Somalia - President Mwai Kibaki has sent a special message to Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. In the message delivered on Wednesday in Mogadishu by Foreign Affairs Minister Moses Wetangula, President Kibaki underscored the need for a regional initiative to resolve the re-emergence of dispute between Sudan and South Sudan that is threatening to develop into a fully fledged conflict. President Kibaki's move to urge IGAD member states to work together in ensuring regional peace follows a request made by South Sudan President Salva Kiir for Kenya's intervention to have a regional summit to discuss the hostilities between Sudan and South Sudan. The two countries are members of IGAD. President Kibaki has in the past sent similar messages to other IGAD member states including Uganda and Ethiopia. The special message was received on behalf of the Somali President by the acting Somali President, who is also the Speaker of the Transitional Federal Parliament of Somalia, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan and the Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali. Receiving the special message from President Kibaki, the acting Somali President and the Somali Prime Minister pledged their full support to Kenya's peace initiatives not only in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan but also in the whole region. The meeting also discussed the post-London conference on Somalia where Foreign Minister Wetangula urged Somalia to embrace an all inclusive approach that would ensure lasting peace in the troubled Horn of Africa nation.

58,17869,"Juba - The UN Humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, Lise Grande yesterday described the situation in Jonglei as one of the largest, complex and most expensive humanitarian operations in South Sudan from the time of the signing of the CPA in 2005. She was speaking in a press conference at the UNOCHA conference hall.""This humanitarian operation is one of the most complex, expensive and largest in South Sudan from the time of the signing of the CPA,"" she said.Grande said that the humanitarian operation this year is complex in the way that there is poor road network in Jonglei making it expensive. She further said that they had to airlift some of the food items to the area given the condition of the roads in the State.According to her, at least 120,000 people are victims of the ongoing tribal clashes in Jonglei. She added that they are optimistic that the number will hit 180,000. All this number is said to be in need of humanitarian aid.Grande expressed disappointment in the tribal groups whom she said targeted humanitarian services. She described the conditions of the people as serious and that they do not have food and all the other basic needs. Nevertheless, she said that the United Nation and its agencies have been doing a lot in providing humanitarian aid to the affected people.According to her, the World Food Programme (WFP) has assessed that about 80,000 to 90,000 people need food in Jonglei. She also said that the food and other humanitarian aid reached Pibor County and that they are assessing Akobo, Uror and Duk Padiet Counties which she said will immediately receive humanitarian aid after the assessment. The UN also dismissed all the allegations against its work in Jonglei by some people accusing it of taking side and that they are impartial and called on all parties to respect the impartiality of the UN.She also revealed that they registered 350,000 people who were displaced last year and got relief. She added that they are optimistic that the year of 2012 will hit the same mark of last year.The UN is also worried that this year, with serious deficit in South Sudan about three million people will need food in South Sudan. She added that they are going to maintain a large humanitarian operation in South Sudan.Meanwhile the UNICEF representative, Dr. Yasmin Ali Hague said that most of the people affected by the Jonglei clashes are women and children.She recorded a number of 342 abducted children with 184 being boys and 158 girls adding that 250 of the children are reported to have been killed and that they had

59,18217,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards - to whom quoted text may be attributed - at the press briefing, on 7 March 2014, at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. UNHCR is deeply concerned about the risk to people in South Sudan, including refugees in Upper Nile State, if conditions don't allow us to help deliver food to them soon. Refugees in the Maban camps last received food in February and may only access partial food rations this month. Recent cases of severe malnutrition including kwashiorkor among children have us particularly worried at the risks of prolonged disruption. UNHCR, WFP and other partners normally preposition food and other relief items during the first quarter of the year in preparation for the rainy season. The violent clashes in Malakal and other strategic river and road transport towns this year have made pre-positioning impossible. Unless food is delivered immediately, the health and nutrition status of refugees will become severely compromised. We are in the dry season, the traditional hunger gap, when refugees are unable to grow food to supplement the WFP rations. The problem is not just food shortages but the safe passage of other humanitarian relief supplies too. Needy populations in Upper Nile state, including refugees, internally displaced persons and increasingly host communities, are all suffering with this crisis. It comes on top of, and has been exacerbated by, the armed conflict that has overwhelmed parts of the country for nearly three months. While Maban County, which hosts 130,000 refugees from Sudan's embattled southern Blue Nile State, has not been directly impacted by the war, general insecurity and border restrictions along supply corridors has prevented delivery of relief items since the beginning of the year. The situation will be compounded by the onset of seasonal rains, when roads become impassable. At greatest risk is about one-third of the refugee population comprising children under five years of age, pregnant and lactating women, elderly and disabled persons and persons who are chronically ill. As the rains start - normally in April - vulnerability to water-borne diseases, malaria and respiratory tract infection will increase. In recent weeks, there have been several cases of kwashiorkor among very young children in the refugee camps, which is symptomatic of protein deficiency that can be caused by illness. Food shortages could moreover lead to conflict between refugees and host communities foraging for wild fruits and vegetables. Already, we have seen tensions over grazing lands and open water sources. Apart from refugees, who are the responsibility of the Government and UNHCR to protect and assist, tens of thousands of internally displaced persons face even worse conditions in different parts of Upper Nile State. There is a strong likelihood many will make their way across the border to Ethiopia in search of humanitarian assistance.

60,17869,"Juba - The UN Humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, Lise Grande yesterday described the situation in Jonglei as one of the largest, complex and most expensive humanitarian operations in South Sudan from the time of the signing of the CPA in 2005. She was speaking in a press conference at the UNOCHA conference hall.""This humanitarian operation is one of the most complex, expensive and largest in South Sudan from the time of the signing of the CPA,"" she said.Grande said that the humanitarian operation this year is complex in the way that there is poor road network in Jonglei making it expensive. She further said that they had to airlift some of the food items to the area given the condition of the roads in the State.According to her, at least 120,000 people are victims of the ongoing tribal clashes in Jonglei. She added that they are optimistic that the number will hit 180,000. All this number is said to be in need of humanitarian aid.Grande expressed disappointment in the tribal groups whom she said targeted humanitarian services. She described the conditions of the people as serious and that they do not have food and all the other basic needs. Nevertheless, she said that the United Nation and its agencies have been doing a lot in providing humanitarian aid to the affected people.According to her, the World Food Programme (WFP) has assessed that about 80,000 to 90,000 people need food in Jonglei. She also said that the food and other humanitarian aid reached Pibor County and that they are assessing Akobo, Uror and Duk Padiet Counties which she said will immediately receive humanitarian aid after the assessment. The UN also dismissed all the allegations against its work in Jonglei by some people accusing it of taking side and that they are impartial and called on all parties to respect the impartiality of the UN.She also revealed that they registered 350,000 people who were displaced last year and got relief. She added that they are optimistic that the year of 2012 will hit the same mark of last year.The UN is also worried that this year, with serious deficit in South Sudan about three million people will need food in South Sudan. She added that they are going to maintain a large humanitarian operation in South Sudan.Meanwhile the UNICEF representative, Dr. Yasmin Ali Hague said that most of the people affected by the Jonglei clashes are women and children.She recorded a number of 342 abducted children with 184 being boys and 158 girls adding that 250 of the children are reported to have been killed and that they had verified 70 prior to the current escalation in the State.",-1,,juba un humanitarian coordinator south sudan lise grande yesterday described situation jonglei one largest complex expensive humanitarian
